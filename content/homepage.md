<h1 class="tc">Humanities & Data Science Institute</h1>

<h3 class="tc">June 5 – 9, 2023</h3>

Despite efforts to foreground the interdisciplinarity of data science, its practitioners and proponents rarely engage seriously with the humanities. And for most humanists, the technical skills required for experimenting with data-driven and computational methods seem either out of reach or suspicious.

The Humanities + Data Science Institute attempts to bridge these gaps at Princeton. Run by the [Center for Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu/) (CDH), the Institute is supported by a [Magic Grant for Innovation](https://humanities.princeton.edu/funding-opportunities/magic-grants-for-innovation/2019-20-magic-projects-global-initiatives-and-special-grants/) from the [Princeton Humanities Council](https://humanities.princeton.edu/).

This five-day Institute will be accessible to Princeton faculty and graduate students with no experience in code or data and will empower scholars from the humanities to engage with the conceptual, practical, and ethical aspects of data science. Participants will gain hands-on experience in emerging methods in data science, and will design a project that they will pursue during the academic year. They will become informed interlocutors who can demonstrate the potential as well as the risks of computational analysis in their own fields.

The first Institute was run January 9 – 13, 2023. Subscribe to the CDH newsletter (at the [bottom of our homepage](https://cdh.princeton.edu/)) for word on future iterations of the Institute.
