## Data Sets & Data Work üíæ

The Center for Digital Humanities publishes datasets through research partnerships and curation grants. [They can be viewed here](https://cdh.princeton.edu/research/data-curation/datasets/). The CDH also curates a list of [Humanities Datasets in Context](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBORIU3yMiD240Ivc1fQpGSbKz_L4SOom1ntYlHHGKU/edit?usp=sharing), organized by discipline and annotated with information about data format and collection practices.

### Campus Resources

- [Princeton Research Data Service](https://researchdata.princeton.edu/), for "expert services and infrastructure to store, manage, retain, and curate digital research data."
- Princeton University Libraries [Data and Statistical Services](https://dss.princeton.edu/)
- Princeton University [Art Museum API Documentation](https://github.com/Princeton-University-Art-Museum/puam-api-docs)

### General Portals for Humanities Data

- Matthew Lavin's [humanitiesdata.com](https://humanitiesdata.com/) contains a running list of datasets and recipes
- [Datasets list maintained by Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/Datasets/Datasets.html), broken down by subject and including example uses and tutorials for each dataset.
- [Alan Liu's DH Toychest](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244469/Data%20Collections%20and%20Datasets), list of demo corpora (text collections ready for use)
- [Journal of Open Humanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/), peer-reviewed forum for reports on the curation and publication of new datasets. Articles describe "humanities research objects or techniques with high potential for reuse."
- [Rutgers University Libraries](https://rutgersdh.github.io/dh-sources/)' "list of collections and datasets that are (mostly) distinctive or unique to Rutgers, and which may serve as excellent source material for digital humanities research or pedagogical projects."
- [UC Berkeley Library's Text Mining & Computational Text Analysis](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=491766&p=7828496) web portal, with tutorials, sources, etc.

## Technical Instruction ‚öôÔ∏è

### Python Notebooks & Textbooks

Quinn Dombrowski curates a list of [Jupyter Notebooks for digital humanities](https://github.com/quinnanya/dh-jupyter). These notebooks, in the spirit of "literate programming," contain data files and executable code interwoven with textual descriptions of what's happening.

Peace Ossom-Williamson and Kenton Rambsy, [*The Data Notebook*](https://uta.pressbooks.pub/datanotebook/) (Mavs Open Press, 2021), a platform-agnostic "online suite of open interactive resources" on the principles of data storytelling.
