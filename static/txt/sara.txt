I 
THE  LUXEMBOURG  GARDENS 

"The  time  has  now  come  for  me  to  hear  a  step  in  the  passage," 
said  Bernard  to  himself.  He  raised  his  head  and  listened.  Noth- 
ing! His  father  and  elder  brother  were  away  at  the  law-courts; 
his  mother  paying  visits;  his  sister  at  a  concert;  as  for  his  small 
brother  Caloub — the  youngest — he  was  safely  shut  up  for  the 
whole  afternoon  in  his  day-school.  Bernard  Profitendieu  had 
stayed  at  home  to  cram  for  his  "hachot" ;  ^  he  had  only  three 
more  weeks  before  him.  His  family  respected  his  solitude — not 
so  the  demon !  Although  Bernard  had  stripped  off  his  coat,  he 
was  stifling.  The  window  that  looked  on  to  the  street  stood  open, 
but  it  let  in  nothing  but  heat.  His  forehead  was  streaming.  A 
drop  of  perspiration  came  dripping  from  his  nose  and  fell  on  to 
the  letter  he  was  holding  in  his  hand. 

"Pretending  to  be  a  tear!"  thought  he.  "But  it's  better  to 
sweat  than  to  weep." 

Yes;  the  date  was  conclusive.  No  one  could  be  in  question  but 
him,  Bernard  himself.  Impossible  to  doubt  it.  The  letter  was 
addressed  to  his  mother — a  love-letter — seventeen  years  old,  un- 
signed. 

"What  can  this  initial  stand  for?  A  'V?  It  might  just  as  well 
be  an  'N.'  .  .  .  Would  it  be  becoming  to  question  my  mother? 
.  .  .  We  must  give  her  credit  for  good  taste.  I'm  free  to  imagine 
he's  a  prince.  It  wouldn't  advance  matters  much  to  know  that 
I  was  the  son  of  a  rapscallion.  There's  no  better  cure  for  the 
fear  of  taking  after  one's  father,  than  not  to  know  who  he  is. 
The  mere  fact  of  enquiry  binds  one.  The  only  thing  to  do  is 
to  welcome  deliverance  and  not  attempt  to  go  any  deeper.  Be- 
sides which,  I've  had  sufficient  for  the  day." 

I  Schoolboy's  slang  for  the  baccalaureat  examination. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  4 

Bernard  folded  the  letter  up  again.  It  was  on  paper  of  the 
same  size  and  shape  as  the  other  twelve  in  the  packet.  They 
were  tied  up  with  pink  ribbon  which  there  had  been  no  need 
for  him  to  untie,  and  which  he  was  easily  able  to  slip  round 
the  bundle  again  to  keep  it  tight.  He  put  the  bundle  back  into 
the  casket  and  the  casket  back  into  the  drawer  of  the  console- 
table.  The  drawer  was  not  open.  It  had  yielded  its  secret  from 
above.  Bernard  fitted  together  the  pieces  of  wood  which  formed 
its  top,  and  which  were  made  to  support  a  heavy  slab  of  onyx, 
re-adjusted  the  slab  carefully  and  gently,  and  put  back  in  their 
places  on  the  top,  a  pair  of  glass  candelabra  and  a  cumbersome 
clock,  which  he  had  been  amusing  himself  by  repairing. 

The  clock  struck  four.  He  had  set  it  to  the  right  time. 

"His  Honour  the  judge  and  his  learned  son  the  barrister  will 
not  be  back  before  six.  I  shall  have  time.  When  His  Honour 
comes  in  he  must  find  a  letter  from  me  on  his  writing  table, 
informing  him  in  eloquent  terms  of  my  departure.  But  before 
I  write  it,  I  feel  that  it's  absolutely  essential  to  air  my  mind  a 
little.  I  must  talk  to  my  dear  Olivier,  and  make  certain  of  a 
perch — at  any  rate  a  temporary  one.  Olivier,  my  friend,  the 
time  has  come  for  me  to  put  your  good-fellowship  to  the  test, 
and  for  you  to  show  your  mettle.  The  fine  thing  about  our 
friendship  so  far  has  been  that  we  have  never  made  any  use  of 
one  another.  Pooh!  it  can't  be  unpleasant  to  ask  a  favour  that's 
amusing  to  grant.  The  tiresome  thing  is  that  Olivier  won't  be 
alone.  Never  mind!  I  shall  have  to  take  him  aside.  I  want  to 
appal  him  by  my  calm.  It's  when  things  are  most  extraordinary 
that  I  feel  most  at  home." 

The  street  where  Bernard  Profitendieu  had  lived  until  then 
was  quite  close  to  the  Luxembourg  Gardens.  There,  in  the  path 
that  overlooks  the  Medici  fountains,  some  of  his  schoolfellows 
were  in  the  habit  of  meeting  every  Wednesday  afternoon,  be- 
tween four  and  six.  The  talk  was  of  art,  philosophy,  sport, 
politics  and  literature.  Bernard  walked  to  the  gardens  quickly, 
but  as  soon  as  he  caught  sight  of  Olivier  Molinier  through  the 
railings,  he  slackened  his  pace.  The  gathering  that  day  was 
more  numerous  than  usual — because  of  the  fine  weather,  no 
doubt.  Some  of  the  boys  who  were  there  were  new-comers. 


5  THE   LUXEMBOURG   GARDENS 

whom  Bernard  had  never  seen  before.  Every  one  of  them,  as 
soon  as  he  was  in  company  with  the  others,  lost  his  naturalness 
and  began  to  act  a  part. 

Olivier  blushed  .when  he  saw  Bernard  coming  up.  He  left  the 
side  of  a  young  woman  to  whom  he  had  been  talking  and  walked 
away  a  little  abruptly.  Bernard  was  his  most  intimate  friend, 
so  that  he  took  great  pains  not  to  show  that  he  liked  being 
with  him;  sometimes  he  would  even  pretend  not  to  see  him. 

Before  joining  him,  Bernard  had  to  run  the  gauntlet  of  sev- 
eral groups  and,  as  he  himself  affected  not  to  be  looking  for 
Olivier,  he  lingered  among  the  others. 

Four  of  his  schoolfellows  were  surrounding  a  little  fellow 
with  a  beard  and  a  pince-nez,  who  was  perceptibly  older  than 
the  rest.  This  was  Dhurmer.  He  was  holding  a  book  and  ad- 
dressing one  boy  in  particular,  though  at  the  same  time  he  was 
obviously  delighted  that  the  others  were  listening. 

"I  can't  help  it,"  he  was  saying,  "I've  got  as  far  as  page 
thirty  without  coming  across  a  single  colour  or  a  single  word 
that  makes  a  picture.  He  speaks  of  a  woman  and  I  don't  know 
whether  her  dress  was  red  or  blue.  As  far  as  I'm  concerned,  if 
there  are  no  colours,  it's  useless,  I  can  see  nothing."  And 
feeling  that  the  less  he  was  taken  in  earnest,  the  more  he  must 
exaggerate,  he  repeated:   " — absolutely  nothing!" 

Bernard  stopped  attending;  he  thought  it  would  be  ill- 
mannered  to  walk  away  too  quickly,  but  he  began  to  listen  to 
some  others  who  were  quarrelling  behind  him  and  who  had 
been  joined  by  Olivier  after  he  had  left  the  young  woman; 
one  of  them  was  sitting  on  a  bench,  reading  L' Action  Frangaise. 

Amongst  all  these  youths  how  grave  Olivier  Molinier  looks! 
And  yet  he  was  one  of  the  youngest.  His  face,  his  expression, 
which  are  still  almost  a  child's,  reveal  a  mind  older  than  his 
years.  He  blushes  easily.  There  is  something  tender "  about 
him.  But  however  gracious  his  manners,  some  kind  of  secret 
reserve,  some  kind  of  sensitive  delicacy,  keeps  his  schoolfellows 
at  a  distance.  This  is  a  grief  to  him.  But  for  Bernard,  it  would 
be  a  greater  grief  still. 

Molinier,  like  Bernard,  had  stayed  a  minute  or  two  with 
each  of  the  groups — out  of  a  wish  to  be  agreeable,  not  that 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  6 

anything  he  heard  interested  him.  He  leant  over  the  reader's 
shoulder,  and  Bernard,  without  turning  round,  heard  him 
say: 

"You  shouldn't  read  the  papers — they'll  give  you  apoplexy." 

The  other  replied  tartly:  "As  for  you,  the  very  name  of 
Maurras  makes  you  turn  green." 

A  third  boy  asked,  deridingly:  "Do  Maurras's  articles  amuse 
you?" 

And  the  first  answered:  "They  bore  me  bloody  well  stiff,  but 
I  think  he's  right." 

Then  a  fourth,  whose  voice  Bernard  didn't  recognize:  "Un- 
less a  thing  bores  you,  you  think  there's  no  depth  in  it." 

"You  seem  to  think  that  one's  only  got  to  be  stupid  to  be 
funny." 

"Come  along,"  whispered  Bernard,  suddenly  seizing  Olivier 
by  the  arm  and  drawing  him  aside.  "Answer  quickly.  I'm  in 
a  hurry.  You  told  me  you  didn't  sleep  on  the  same  floor  as 
your  parents?" 

"I've  shown  you  the  door  of  my  room.  It  opens  straight 
on  to  the  staircase,  half  a  floor  below  our  flat." 

"Didn't  you  say  your  brother  slept  with  you?" 

"George.  Yes." 

"Are  you  two  alone?" 

"Yes." 

"Can  the  youngster  hold  his  tongue?" 

"If  necessary." 

"Listen.  I've  left  home — or  at  any  rate  I'm  going  to  this 
evening.  I  don't  know  where  to  go  yet.  Can  you  take  me  in 
for  one  night?" 

Olivier  turned  very  pale.  His  emotion  was  so  great  that  he 
was  hardly  able  to  look  at  Bernard. 

"Yes,"  said  he,  "but  don't  come  before  eleven.  Mamma 
comes  down  to  say  good-night  to  us  and  lock  the  door  every 
evening." 

"But  then  .  .  .  ?" 

Olivier  smiled.  "I've  got  another  key.  You  must  knock  softly, 
so  as  not  to  wake  George  if  he's  asleep." 


7  THE  LUXEMBOURG   GARDENS 

"Will  the  concierge  let  me  in?" 

"I'll  warn  him.  Oh,  I'm  on  very  good  terms  with  him.  It's 
he  who  gives  me  the  key.  Good-bye!  Till  to-night!" 

They  parted  without  shaking  hands.  While  Bernard  was 
walking  away,  reflecting  on  the  letter  he  meant  to  write  for 
the  magistrate  to  find  when  he  came  in,  Olivier,  not  wishing 
it  to  be  thought  that  Bernard  was  the  only  person  he  liked 
talking  to  in  private,  went  up  to  Lucien  Bercail,  who  was 
sitting  by  himself  as  usual,  for  he  was  generally  left  a  little 
out  of  it  by  the  others.  Olivier  would  be  very  fond  of  him, 
if  he  didn't  prefer  Bernard.  Lucien  is  as  timid  as  Bernard  is 
spirited.  He  cannot  hide  his  weakness;  he  seems  to  live  only 
with  his  head  and  his  heart.  He  hardly  ever  dares  to  make 
advances,  but  when  he  sees  Olivier  coming  towards  him,  he 
is  beside  himself  with  joy;  Lucien  writes  poetry — everyone 
suspects  as  much;  but  I  am  pretty  sure  that  Olivier  is  the  only 
person  to  whom  Lucien  talks  of  his  ideas.  They  walked  to- 
gether to  the  edge  of  the  terrace. 

"What  1  should  like,"  said  Lucien,  "would  be  to  tell  the 
story — no,  not  of  a  person,  but  of  a  place — well,  for  instance, 
of  a  garden  path,  like  this — just  tell  what  happens  in  it  from 
morning  to  evening.  First  of  all,  come  the  children's  nurses  and 
the  children,  and  the  babies'  nurses  with  ribbons  in  their 
caps.  .  .  .  No,  no  .  .  .  first  of  all,  people  who  are  grey  all 
over  and  ageless  and  sexless  and  who  come  to  sweep  the  path, 
and  water  the  grass,  and  change  the  flowers — in  fact,  to  set 
the  stage  and  get  ready  the  scenery  before  the  opening  of  the 
gates.  D'you  see?  Then  the  nurses  come  in  .  .  .  the  kids  make 
mud-pies  and  squabble;  the  nurses  smack  them.  Then  the 
little  boys  come  out  of  school;  then  there  are  the  workgirls; 
then  the  poor  people  who  eat  their  scrap  upon  a  bench,  and 
later  people  come  to  meet  each  other,  and  others  avoid  each 
other,  and  others  go  by  themselves — dreamers.  And  then  when 
the  band  plays  and  the  shops  close,  there's  the  crowd.  .  .  . 
Students,  like  us;  in  the  evening,  lovers  who  embrace — others 
who  cry  at  parting.  And  at  the  end,  when  the  day  is  over, 
there's   an   old   couple  .  .  .  And   suddenly   the   drum   beats. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  8 

Closing  time!  Everyone  goes  off.  The  play  is  ended.  Do  you 
understand?  Something  which  gives  the  impression  of  the  end 
of  everything — of  death  .  .  .  but  without  mentioning  death, 
of  course." 

"Yes,  I  see  it  all  perfectly,"  said  Olivier,  who  was  thinking 
of  Bernard  and  had  not  listened  to  a  word. 

"And  that's  not  all,"  went  on  Lucien,  enthusiastically;  "I 
should  like  to  have  a  kind  of  epilogue  and  show  the  same 
garden  path  at  night,  after  everyone  has  gone,  deserted  and 
much  more  beautiful  than  in  the  day-time.  In  the  deep  silence; 
all  the  natural  sounds  intensified — the  sound  of  the  fountain, 
and  the  wind  in  the  trees,  and  the  song  of  a  night-bird.  First 
of  all,  I  thought  that  I'd  bring  in  some  ghosts  to  wander 
about — or  perhaps  some  statues — but  I  think  that  would  be 
more  common  place.  What  do  you  say?" 

"No,  no!  No  statues,  no  statues!"  said  Olivier  absent- 
mindedly;  and  then,  seeing  the  other's  disappointed  face:  "Well, 
old  fellow,  if  you  bring  it  off,  it'll  be  splendid!"  he  exclaimed 
warmly. 


II 

THE  PROFITENDIEUS 

There  is  no  trace  in  Poussin's  letters  of  any 
feeling  of  obligation  towards   his  parents. 

He  never  in  later  days  showed  any  regret 
at  having  left  them;  transplanted  to  Rome  of 
his  own  free  will,  he  lost  all  desire  to  return 
to  his  home — and  even,  it  would  seem,  all 
recollection  of  it. 

Paul  Desjardins  (Poussin). 

Monsieur  Profitendieu  was  in  a  hurry  to  get  home  and  wished 
that  his  colleague  Molinier,  who  was  keeping  him  company 
up  the  Boulevard  St.  Germain,  would  walk  a  little  faster. 
Alberic  Profitendieu  had  just  had  an  unusually  heavy  day 
at  the  law-courts;  an  uncomfortable  sensation  in  his  right  side 
was  causing  him  some  uneasiness;  fatigue  in  his  case  usually 
went  to  his  liver,  which  was  his  weak  point.  He  was  thinking 
of  his  bath;  nothing  rested  him  better  after  the  cares  of  the 
day  than  a  good  bath — with  an  eye  to  which  he  had  taken 
no  tea  that  afternoon,  esteeming  it  imprudent  to  get  into  any 
sort  of  water — even  warm — with  a  loaded  stomach.  Merely  a 
prejudice,  perhaps;  but  prejudices  are  the  props  of  civilisation. 
Oscar  Molinier  walked  as  quickly  as  he  could  and  made  every 
effort  to  keep  up  with  his  companion;  but  he  was  much  shorter 
than  Profitendieu  and  his  crural  development  was  slighter; 
besides  which  there  was  a  little  fatty  accumulation  round  his 
heart  and  he  easily  became  short-winded.  Profitendieu,  who 
was  still  sound  at  the  age  of  fifty-five,  with  a  well-developed 
chest  and  a  brisk  gait,  would  have  gladly  given  him  the  slip; 
but  he  was  very  particular  as  to  the  proprieties;  his  colleague 
was  older  than  he  and  higher  up  in  the  career;  respect  was 
due  to  him.  And  besides,  since  the  death  of  his  wife's  parents, 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  10 

Profitendieu  had  a  very  considerable  fortune  to  be  forgiven 
him,  whereas  Monsieur  Molinier,  who  was  President  de 
chambre,  had  nothing  but  his  salary — a  derisory  salary,  utterly 
disproportionate  to  the  high  situation  he  filled  with  dignity, 
which  was  all  the  more  imposing  because  of  the  mediocrity  it 
cloaked.  Profitendieu  concealed  his  impatience;  he  turned  to 
Molinier  and  looked  at  him  mopping  himself;  for  that  matter, 
he  was  exceedingly  interested  by  what  Molinier  was  saying; 
but  their  point  of  view  was  not  the  same  and  the  discussion 
was  beginning  to  get  warm. 

"Have  the  house  watched,  by  all  means,"  said  Molinier. 
"Get  the  reports  of  the  concierge  and  the  sham  maid-servant — 
very  good!  But  mind,  if  you  push  the  enquiry  too  far,  the 
affair  will  be  taken  out  of  your  hands.  ...  I  mean  there's  a 
risk  of  your  being  led  on  much  further  than  you  bargained  for." 
"Justice  should  have  no  such  considerations." 
"Tut,  tut,  my  dear  sir;  you  and  I  know  very  well  what 
justice  ought  to  be  and  what  it  is.  We're  all  agreed  that  we 
act  for  the  best,  but,  however  we  act,  we  never  get  nearer  than 
an  approximation.  The  case  before  us  now  is  a  particularly 
delicate  one.  Out  of  the  fifteen  accused  persons — or  persons  who 
at  a  word  from  you  will  be  accused  to-morrow — nine  are  minors. 
And  some  of  these  boys,  as  you  know,  come  of  very  honourable 
families.  In  such  circumstances,  I  consider  that  to  issue  a 
warrant  at  all  would  be  the  greatest  mistake.  The  newspapers 
will  get  hold  of  the  affair  and  you  open  the  door  to  every  sort 
of  blackmail  and  calumny.  In  spite  of  all  your  efforts  you'll 
not  prevent  names  from  coming  out.  .  ,  .  It's  no  business  of 
mine  to  give  you  advice — on  the  contrary — it's  much  more  my 
place  to  receive  it.  You're  well  aware  how  highly  I've  always 
rated  your  lucidity  and  your  fair-mindedness.  .  .  .  But  if  I 
were  you,  this  is  what  I  should  do:  I  should  try  to  put  an  end 
to  this  abominable  scandal  by  laying  hold  of  the  four  or  five 
instigators.  .  .  .  Yes!  I  know  they're  difficult  to  catch;  but 
what  the  deuce,  that's  part  of  our  trade.  I  should  have  the 
flat — the  scene  of  the  orgies — closed,  and  I  should  take  steps 
for  the  brazen  young  rascals'  parents  to  be  informed  of  the 


II  THE   PROFITENDIEUS 

affair — quietly  and  secretly;  and  merely  in  order  to  avoid  any 
repetition  of  the  scandal.  Oh!  as  to  the  women,  collar  them 
by  all  means.  I'm  entirely  with  you  there.  We  seem  to  be  up 
against  a  set  of  creatures  of  unspeakable  perversity,  and  so- 
ciety should  be  cleansed  of  them  at  all  costs.  But,  let  me  re- 
peat, leave  the  boys  alone;  content  yourself  with  giving  them 
a  fright,  and  then  hush  the  matter  up  with  some  vague  term 
like  "youthful  indiscretion."  Their  astonishment  at  having 
got  off  so  cheaply  will  last  them  for  a  long  time  to  come. 
Remember  that  three  of  them  are  not  fourteen  years  old  and 
that  their  parents  no  doubt  consider  them  angels  of  purity 
and  innocence.  But  really,  my  dear  fellow,  between  ourselves, 
come  now,  did  we  think  of  women  when  we  were  that  age?" 

He  came  to  a  stop,  breathless  rather  with  talking  than 
with  walking,  and  forced  Profitendieu,  whose  sleeve  he  was 
holding,  to  stop  too. 

"Or  if  we  thought  of  them,"  he  went  on,  "it  was  ideally — 
mystically — religiously,  if  I  may  say  so.  The  boys  of  to-day, 
don't  you  think,  have  no  ideals — no!  no  ideals  ...  A  propos, 
how  are  yours?  Of  course,  I'm  not  alluding  to  them  when 
I  speak  so.  I  know  that  with  your  careful  bringing-up — with 
the  education  you've  given  them,  there's  no  fear  of  any  such 
reprehensible  follies." 

And  indeed,  up  to  that  time,  Profitendieu  had  had  every 
reason  to  be  satisfied  with  his  sons.  But  he  was  without 
illusions — the  best  education  in  the  world  was  of  no  avail 
against  bad  instincts.  God  be  praised,  his  children  had  no  bad 
instincts — nor  Molinier's  either,  no  doubt;  they  were  their  own 
protectors  against  bad  companions  and  bad  books.  For  of  what 
use  is  it  to  forbid  what  we  can't  prevent?  If  books  are  for- 
bidden, children  read  them  on  the  sly.  His  own  plan  was  per- 
fectly simple — he  didn't  forbid  bad  books,  but  he  so  managed 
that  his  children  had  no  desire  to  read  them.  As  for  the  matter 
in  question,  he  would  think  it  over  again,  and  in  any  case,  he 
promised  Molinier  to  do  nothing  without  consulting  him.  He 
would  simply  give  orders  for  a  discreet  watch  to  be  kept,  and 
as  the  thing  had  been  going  on  for  three  months,  it  might 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  12 

just  as  well  go  on  for  another  few  days  or  weeks.  Besides,  the 
summer  holidays  were  upon  them  and  would  necessarily  dis- 
perse the  delinquents.  Au  revoir! 

At  last  Profitendieu  was  able  to  quicken  his  pace. 

As  soon  as  he  got  in,  he  hurried  to  his  dressing-room  and 
turned  on  the  water  for  his  bath.  Antoine  had  been  looking  out 
for  his  master's  return  and  managed  to  come  across  him  in 
the  passage. 

This  faithful  man-servant  had  been  in  the  family  for  the 
last  fifteen  years;  he  had  seen  the  children  grow  up.  He  had 
seen  a  great  many  things — and  suspected  a  great  many  more; 
but  he  pretended  not  to  notice  anything  his  masters  wished 
to  keep  hidden. 

Bernard  was  not  without  affection  for  Antoine;  he  had  not 
wanted  to  leave  the  house  without  saying  good-bye  to  him. 
Perhaps  it  was  out  of  irritation  against  his  family  that  he 
made  a  point  of  confiding  to  a  servant  that  he  was  going  away, 
when  none  of  his  own  people  knew  it;  but,  in  excuse  for  Ber- 
nard, it  must  be  pointed  out  that  none  of  his  own  people 
were  at  that  time  in  the  house.  And  besides,  Bernard  could 
not  have  said  good-bye  to  them  without  the  risk  of  being 
detained.  Whereas  to  Antoine,  he  could  simply  say:  "I'm 
going  away."  But  as  he  said  it,  he  put  out  his  hand  with  such 
a  solemn  air  that  the  old  servant  was  astonished. 

"Not  coming  back  to  dinner.  Master  Bernard?" 

"Nor  to  sleep,  Antoine."  And  as  Antoine  hesitated,  not  know- 
ing what  he  was  expected  to  understand,  nor  whether  he  ought 
to  ask  any  further  questions,  Bernard  repeated  still  more 
meaningly:  "I'm  going  away";  then  he  added:  "I've  left  a 
letter  for  .  .  ."  He  couldn't  bring  himself  to  say  "Papa,"  so 
he  corrected  his  sentence  to  "on  the  study  writing  table.  Good- 
bye." 

As  he  squeezed  Antoine's  hand,  he  felt  as  moved  as  if  he  were 
then  and  there  saying  good-bye  to  all  his  past  life.  He  repeated 
"good-bye"  very  quickly  and  then  hurried  oflF  before  the  sob 
that  was  rising  in  his  throat  burst  from  him. 

Antoine  wondered  whether  it  were  not  a  heavy  responsibility 


13  THE   PROFITENDIEUS 

to  let  him  go  in  this  way — but  how  could  he  have  prevented 
him? 

That  this  departure  of  Bernard's  would  be  a  blow  to  the 
whole  family — an  unexpected — a  monstrous  blow— Antoine  in- 
deed was  well  aware;  but  his  business  as  a  perfect  servant  was  to 
pretend  to  take  it  as  a  matter  of  course.  It  was  not  for  him 
to  know  what  Monsieur  Profitendieu  was  ignorant  of.  No 
doubt,  he  might  simply  have  said  to  him:  "Do  you  know, 
sir,  that  Master  Bernard  has  gone  away?"  But  by  so  saying, 
he  would  lose  his  advantage,  and  that  was  highly  undesirable.  If 
he  awaited  his  master  so  impatiently,  it  was  to  drop  out  in  a 
non-committal,  deferential  voice,  and  as  if  it  were  a  simple 
message  left  by  Bernard,  this  sentence,  which  he  had  elab- 
orately prepared  beforehand : 

"Before  going  away,  sir.  Master  Bernard  left  a  letter  for 
you  in  the  study" — a  sentence  so  simple  that  there  was  a  risk 
of  its  passing  unperceived;  he  had  racked  his  brains  in  vain 
for  something  which  would  be  more  striking,  and  had  found 
nothing  which  would  be  at  the  same  time  natural.  But  as 
Bernard  never  left  home,  Profitendieu,  whom  Antoine  was 
watching  out  of  the  corner  of  his  eye,  could  not  repress  a  start. 

"Before  going  .  .  ." 

He  pulled  himself  up  at  once;  it  was  not  for  him  to  show 
his  astonishment  before  a  subordinate;  the  consciousness  of  his 
superiority  never  left  him.  His  tone  as  he  continued  was  very 
calm — really  magisterial. 

"Thank  you."  And  as  he  went  towards  his  study:  "Where 
did  you  say  the  letter  was?" 

"On  the  writing  table,  sir." 

And  in  fact,  as  Profitendieu  entered  the  room,  he  saw  an 
envelope  placed  conspicuously  opposite  the  chair  in  which 
he  usually  sat  when  writing;  but  Antoine  was  not  to  be  choked 
off  so  easily,  and  Monsieur  Profitendieu  had  not  read  two 
lines  of  the  letter,  when  he  heard  a  knock  at  the  door. 

"I  forgot  to  tell  you,  sir,  that  there  are  two  persons  wait- 
ing to  see  you  in  the  back  drawing-room." 

"Who  are  they?" 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  14 

"I  don't  know,  sir." 

"Are  they  together?" 

"They  don't  seem  to  be,  sir," 

"What  do  they  want?" 

"I  don't  know.  They  want  to  see  you,  sir." 

Profitendieu  felt  his  patience  giving  way. 

"I  have  already  said  and  repeated  that  I  don't  want  to  be 
disturbed  when  I'm  at  home — especially  at  this  time  of  day; 
I  have  my  consulting  room  at  the  law-courts.  Why  did  you 
let  them  in?" 

"They  both  said  they  had  something  very  urgent  to  say 
to  you,  sir." 

"Have  they  been  here  long?" 

"Nearly  an  hour." 

Profitendieu  took  a  few  steps  up  and  down  the  room,  and 
passed  one  hand  over  his  forehead;  with  the  other  he  held 
Bernard's  letter.  Antoine  stood  at  the  door,  dignified  and  im- 
passive. At  last,  he  had  the  joy  of  seeing  the  judge  lose  his 
temper  and  of  hearing  him  for  the  first  time  in  his  life  stamp 
his  foot  and  scold  angrily. 

"Deuce  take  it  all!  Can't  you  leave  me  alone?  Can't  you 
leave  me  alone?  Tell  them  I'm  busy.  Tell  them  to  come  another 
day." 

Antoine  had  no  sooner  left  the  room  than  Profitendieu  ran 
to  the  door. 

"Antoine!  Antoine!  And  then  go  and  turn  off  my  bath." 

Much  inclined  for  a  bath,  truly!  He  went  up  to  the  window 
and  read: 


Sir, 

Owing  to  an  accidental  discovery  I  happened  to  make  this 
afternoon,  I  have  become  aware  that  I  must  cease  to  regard  you 
as  my  father.  This  is  an  immense  relief  to  me.  Realizing  as  1  do 
how  little  affection  I  feel  for  you,  I  have  for  a  long  time  past 
been  thinking  myself  an  unnatural  son;  I  prefer  knowing  I  am 
not  your  son  at  all.  You  will  perhaps  consider  that  I  ought  to  be 
grateful  to  you  for  having  treated  me  as  if  I  were  one  of  your 
own  children;  but,  in  the  first  place,  I  have  always  felt  the  dif- 


15  THE   PROFITENDIEUS 

ference  between  your  behaviour  to  them  and  to  me,  and,  sec- 
ondly, I  know  you  well  enough  to  feel  certain  that  you  acted  as 
you  did  because  you  were  afraid  of  the  scandal  and  because 
you  wished  to  conceal  a  situation  which  did  you  no  great  honour 
— and,  finally,  because  you  could  not  have  acted  otherwise.  I 
prefer  to  leave  without  seeing  my  mother  again,  because  I  am 
afraid  that  the  emotion  of  bidding  her  a  final  good-bye  might 
aff'ect  me  too  much  and  also  because  she  might  feel  herself  in  a 
false  position  in  my  presence — which  I  should  dislike.  I  doubt 
whether  she  has  any  very  lively  affection  for  me;  as  I  was  al- 
most always  away  at  school,  she  never  had  time  to  know  much 
of  me,  and  as  the  sight  of  me  must  have  continually  reminded 
her  of  an  episode  in  her  life  which  she  would  have  liked  to 
efi'ace,  I  think  my  departure  will  be  a  relief  and  a  pleasure  to 
her.  Tell  her,  if  you  have  the  courage  to,  that  I  bear  her  no 
grudge  for  having  made  a  bastard  of  me;  on  the  contrary,  I 
prefer  that  to  knowing  I  am  your  son.  (Pray  excuse  me  for 
writing  in  this  way;  it  is  not  my  object  to  insult  you;  but  my 
words  will  give  you  an  excuse  for  despising  me  and  that  will 
be  a  relief  to  you.) 

If  you  wish  me  to  keep  silent  as  to  the  secret  reasons  which 
have  induced  me  to  leave  your  roof,  I  must  beg  you  not  to  at- 
tempt to  make  me  return  to  it.  The  decision  I  have  taken  is 
irrevocable.  I  do  not  know  how  much  you  may  have  spent  on 
supporting  me  up  till  now;  as  long  as  I  was  ignorant  of  the 
truth  I  could  accept  living  at  your  expense,  but  it  is  needless  to 
say  that  I  prefer  to  receive  nothing  from  you  for  the  future. 
The  idea  of  owing  you  anything  is  intolerable  to  me  and  I  think 
I  had  rather  die  of  hunger  than  sit  at  your  table  again.  For- 
tunately I  seem  to  remember  having  heard  that  my  mother  was 
richer  than  you  when  she  married  you.  I  am  free  to  think,  there- 
fore, that  the  burden  of  supporting  me  fell  only  on  her.  I  thank 
her — consider  her  quit  of  anything  else  she  may  owe  me — and 
beg  her  to  forget  me.  You  will  have  no  difficulty  in  explaining 
my  departure  to  those  it  may  surprise.  I  give  you  free  leave  to 
put  what  blame  you  choose  on  me  (though  I  know  well  enough 
that  you  will  not  wait  for  my  leave  to  do  this). 

I  sign  this  letter  with  that  ridiculous  name  of  yours,  which  I 
should  like  to  fling  back  in  your  face,  and  which  I  am  longing 
and  hoping  soon  to  dishonour. 

Bernard   Profitendi  eu. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  16 

P.S.  I  am  leaving  all  my  things  behind  me.  They  belong 
more  legitimately  to  Caloub — at  any  rate  I  hope  so,  for  your 
sake. 

Monsieur  Profitendieu  totters  to  an  arm-chair.  He  wants 
to  reflect,  but  his  mind  is  in  a  confused  whirl.  Moreover  he 
feels  a  little  stabbing  pain  in  his  right  side,  just  below  his  ribs. 
There  can  be  no  question  about  it.  It  is  a  liver  attack.  Would 
there  be  any  Vichy  water  in  the  house?  If  only  his  wife  had 
not  gone  out!  How  is  he  to  break  the  news  of  Bernard's 
flight  to  her?  Ought  he  to  show  her  the  letter?  It  is  an  un- 
just letter — abominably  unjust.  He  ought  to  be  angry.  But  it 
is  not  anger  he  feels — he  wishes  it  were — it  is  sorrow.  He 
breathes  deeply  and  at  each  breath  exhales  an  "Oh,  dear!  Oh, 
dear!"  as  swift  and  low  as  a  sigh.  The  pain  in  his  side  becomes 
one  with  his  other  pain — proves  it — localizes  it.  He  feels  as 
if  his  grief  were  in  his  liver.  He  drops  into  an  arm-chair  and 
re-reads  Bernard's  letter.  He  shrugs  his  shoulders  sadly.  Yes, 
it  is  a  cruel  letter — but  there  is  wounded  vanity,  defiance — 
bravado  in  it,  too.  Not  one  of  his  other  children — his  real 
children — would  have  been  capable — any  more  than  he  would 
have  been  capable  himself— of  writing  it.  He  knows  this,  for 
there  is  nothing  in  them  which  he  does  not  recognize  only  too 
well  in  himself.  It  is  true  that  he  has  always  thought  it  his 
duty  to  blame  Bernard  for  his  rawness,  his  roughness,  his 
unbroken  temper,  but  he  realizes  that  it  is  for  those  very  things 
that  he  loved  him  as  he  had  never  loved  any  of  the  others. 

In  the  next  room,  Cecile,  who  had  come  in  from  her  con- 
cert, had  begun  to  practise  the  piano  and  was  obstinately 
going  over  and  over  again  the  same  phrase  in  a  barcarole.  At 
last  Alberic  Profitendieu  could  bear  it  no  longer.  He  opened 
the  drawing-room  door  a  little  way  and  in  a  plaintive,  half 
supplicating  voice,  for  his  liver  was  beginning  to  hurt  him 
cruelly  (and  besides  he  had  always  been  a  little  frightened 
of  her) : 

"Cecile,  my  dear,"  he  asked,  "would  you  mind  seeing 
whether  there's  any  Vichy  water  in  the  house  and  if  there 
isn't,  sending  out  to  get  some?  and  it  would  be  very  nice  of 
you  to  stop  playing  for  a  little." 


17  THE   PROFITENDIEUS 

"Are  you  ill?" 

"No,  no,  not  at  all.  I've  just  got  something  that  needs  think- 
ing over  a  little  before  dinner,  and  your  music  disturbs  me." 

And  then  a  kindly  feeling — for  he  was  softened  by  suffering — 
made  him  add: 

"That's  a  very  pretty  thing  you're  playing.  What  is  it?" 

But  he  went  away  without  waiting  for  the  answer.  For 
that  matter,  his  daughter,  who  was  aware  that  he  knew  nothing 
whatever  about  music  and  could  not  distinguish  between 
"Viens  Poupoule"  and  the  March  in  T annhduser  (at  least,  so 
she  used  to  say),  had  no  intention  of  answering. 

But  there  he  was  at  the  door  again! 

"Has  your  mother  come  in?" 

"No,  not  yet." 

Absurd!  she  would  be  coming  in  so  late  that  he  would  have 
no  time  to  speak  to  her  before  dinner.  What  could  he  invent  to 
explain  Bernard's  absence?  He  really  couldn't  tell  the  truth — 
let  the  children  into  the  secret  of  their  mother's  temporary 
lapse.  Ah!  all  had  been  forgotten,  forgiven,  made  up.  The 
birth  of  their  last  son  had  cemented  their  reconciliation. 
And  now,  suddenly  this  avenging  spectre  had  re-risen 
from  the  past — this  corpse  had  been  washed  up  again  by  the 
tide. 

Good!  Another  interruption!  As  the  study  door  noiselessly 
opens,  he  slips  the  letter  into  the  inside  pocket  of  his  coat; 
the  portiere  is  gently  raised — Caloub! 

"Oh,  Papa,  please  tell  me  what  this  Latin  sentence  means. 
I  can't  make  head  or  tail  of  it.  .  .  ." 

"I've  already  told  you  not  to  come  in  here  without  knock- 
ing. You  mustn't  disturb  me  like  this  for  anything  and  every- 
thing. You  are  getting  too  much  into  the  habit  of  relying  on 
other  people  instead  of  making  an  effort  yourself.  Yesterday 
it  was  your  geometry  problem,  and  now  to-day  it's  ...  by 
whom  is  your  sentence?" 

Caloub  holds  out  his  copy-book. 

"He  didn't  tell  us;  but  just  look  at  it;  you'll  know  all  right. 
He  dictated  it  to  us.  But  perhaps  I  took  it  down  wrong.  You 
might  at  any  rate  tell  me  if  it's  correct?" 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  18 

Monsieur  Profitendieu  took  the  copy-book,  but  he  was  in  too 
much  pain.  He  gently  pushed  the  child  away. 

"Later  on.  It's  just  dinner  time.  Has  Charles  come  in?" 
"He  went   down   to   his   consulting   room."    (The  barrister 
receives  his  clients  in  a  room  on  the  ground  floor.) 
"Go  and  tell  him  I  want  to  speak  to  him.  Quick!" 
A  ring  at  the  door  bell!  Madame  Profitendieu  at  last!  She 
apologizes  for  being  late.  She  had  a  great  many  visits  to  pay. 
She  is  sorry  to  see  her  husband  so  poorly.  What  can  be  done 
for  him?  He  certainly  looks  very  unwell.  He  won't  be  able 
to  eat  anything.  They  must  sit  down  without  him,  but  after 
dinner,  will  she  come  to  his  study  with  the  children? — Bernard? 
— Oh,  yes;  his  friend  .  .  .  you  know — the  one  he  is  reading 
mathematics  with — came  and  took  him  out  to  dinner. 

Profitendieu  felt  better.  He  had  at  first  been  afraid  he  would 
be  too  ill  to  speak.  And  yet  it  was  necessary  to  give  an  ex- 
planation of  Bernard's  disappearance.  He  knew  now  what  he 
must  say — however  painful  it  might  be.  He  felt  firm  and  de- 
termined. His  only  fear  was  that  his  wife  might  interrupt 
him  by  crying — that  she  might  exclaim — that  she  might 
faint.  .  .  . 

An  hour  later  she  comes  into  the  room  with  the  three  chil- 
dren. He  makes  her  sit  down  beside  him,  close  against  his  arm- 
chair. 

"Try  to  control  yourself,"  he  whispers,  but  in  a  tone  of 
command;  "and  don't  speak  a  word.  We  will  talk  together 
afterwards." 

And  all  the  time  he  is  speaking,  he  holds  one  of  her  hands 
in  both  his. 

"Come,  my  children,  sit  down.  I  don't  like  to  see  you  stand- 
ing there  as  if  you  were  in  front  of  an  examiner.  I  have 
something  very  sad  to  say  to  you.  Bernard  has  left  us  and  we 
shall  not  see  him  again  ...  for  some  time  to  come.  1  must 
now  tell  you  what  I  at  first  concealed  from  you,  because  I 
wanted  you  to  love  Bernard  like  a  brother;  your  mother  and 
I  loved  him  like  our  own  child.  But  he  was  not  our  child  .  .  . 


19  THE   PROFITENDIEUS 

and  one  of  his  uncles — a  brother  of  his  real  mother,  who  con- 
fided him  to  us  on  her  death  bed — came  and  fetched  him  away 
this  evening." 

A  painful  silence  follows  these  words  and  Caloub  sniffles. 
They  all  wait,  expecting  him  to  go  on.  But  he  dimisses  them 
with  a  wave  of  his  hand. 

"You  can  go  now,  my  dears.  I  must  speak  to  your  mother." 

After  they  have  left  the  room,  Monsieur  Profitendieu  re- 
mains silent  for  a  long  time.  The  hand  which  Madame  Profi- 
tendieu had  left  in  his  seems  like  a  dead  thing;  with  the  other 
she  presses  a  handkerchief  to  her  eyes.  Leaning  on  the  writing 
table,  she  turns  her  head  away  to  cry.  Through  the  sobs  which 
shake  her.  Monsieur  Profitendieu  hears  her  murmur: 

"Oh,  how  cruel  of  you!  ...  Oh!  You  have  turned  him 
out.  .  .  ." 

A  moment  ago,  he  had  resolved  to  speak  to  her  without 
showing  her  Bernard's  letter;  but  at  this  unjust  accusation,  he 
holds  it  out: 

"Here!  Read  this." 

"I  can't." 

"You  must  read  it." 

He  has  forgotten  his  pain.  He  follows  her  with  his  eyes  all 
through  the  letter,  line  by  line.  Just  now  when  he  was  speaking, 
he  could  hardly  keep  back  his  tears;  but  now  all  emotion  has 
left  him;  he  watches  his  wife.  What  is  she  thinking?  In  the 
same  plaintive  voice,  broken  by  the  same  sobs,  she  murmurs 
again: 

"Oh!  why  did  you  tell  him?  .  .  .  You  shouldn't  have  told 
him." 

"But  you  can  see  for  yourself  that  I  never  told  him  anything. 
Read  his  letter  more  carefully." 

"I  did  read  it.  .  .  .  But  how  did  he  find  out?  Who  told 
him  then?" 

So  that  is  what  she  is  thinking!  Those  are  the  accents  of 
her  grief! 

This  sorrow  should  bring  them  together,  but,  alas!  Profi- 
dendieu  feels  obscurely  that  their  thoughts  are  travelling  by 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  20 

divergent  ways.  And  while  she  laments  and  accuses  and  re- 
criminates, he  endeavours  to  bend  her  unruly  spirit  and  to 
bring  her  to  a  more  pious  frame  of  mind. 

"This  is  the  expiation,"  he  says. 

He  has  risen,  from  an  instinctive  desire  to  dominate;  he 
stands  there  before  her  upright — forgetful  or  regardless  of  his 
physical  pain — and  lays  his  hand  gravely,  tenderly,  authori- 
tatively on  Marguerite's  shoulder.  He  is  well  aware  that  her 
repentance  for  what  he  chooses  to  consider  a  passing  weakness, 
has  never  been  more  than  half-hearted;  he  would  like  to  tell 
her  now  that  this  sorrow,  this  trial  may  serve  to  redeem  her; 
but  he  can  find  no  formula  to  satisfy  him — none  that  he  can 
hope  she  will  listen  to.  Marguerite's  shoulder  resists  the  gentle 
pressure  of  his  hand.  She  knows  so  well  that  from  every  event 
of  life — even  the  smallest — he  invariably,  intolerably,  extracts, 
as  with  a  forceps,  some  moral  teaching — he  interprets  and 
twists  everything  to  suit  his  own  dogmas.  He  bends  over  her. 
This  is  what  he  would  like  to  say: 

"You  see,  my  dear,  no  good  thing  can  be  born  of  sin.  It 
was  no  use  covering  up  your  fault.  Alas!  I  did  what  I  could 
for  the  child.  I  treated  him  as  my  own.  God  shows  us  to-day 
that  it  was  an  error  to  try  .  .  ." 

But  at  the  first  sentence  he  stops. 

No  doubt  she  understands  these  words,  heavy  with  meaning 
as  they  are;  they  have  struck  home  to  her  heart,  for  though 
she  had  stopped  crying  some  moments  before,  her  sobs  break 
out  afresh,  more  violently  than  ever:  then  she  bows  herself, 
as  though  she  were  going  to  kneel  before  him,  but  he  stoops 
over  her  and  holds  her  up.  What  is  it  she  is  saying  through 
her  tears?  He  stoops  his  ear  almost  to  her  lips  and  hears: 

"You  see  .  .  .  You  see  ...  Oh!  why  did  you  forgive  me? 
Oh!  I  shouldn't  have  come  back." 

He  is  almost  obliged  to  divine  her  words.  Then  she  stops. 
She  too  can  say  no  more.  How  can  she  tell  him  that  she  feels 
imprisoned  in  this  virtue  which  he  exacts  from  her  .  .  .  that 
she  is  stifling  .  .  .  that  it  is  not  so  much  her  fault  that  she 
regrets  now,  as  having  repented  of  it?  Profitendieu  raises  him- 
self. 


21  THE  PROFITENDIEUS 

"My  poor  Marguerite,"  he  says  with  dignity  and  severity, 
"I  am  afraid  you  are  a  little  stubborn  to-night.  It  is  late.  We 
had  better  go  to  bed." 

He  helps  her  up,  leads  her  to  her  room,  puts  his  lips  to  her 
forehead,  then  returns, to  his  study  and  flings  himself  into  an 
armchair.  It  is  a  curious  thing  that  his  liver  attack  has  subsided 
— but  he  feels  shattered.  He  sits  with  his  head  in  his  hands,  too 
sad  to  cry.  ...  He  does  not  hear  a  knock  at  the  door,  but 
at  the  noise  the  door  makes  in  opening,  he  raises  his  head — 
his  son  Charles! 

"I  came  to  say  good-night  to  you." 

He  .comes  up.  He  wants  to  convey  to  his  father  that  he  has 
understood  everything.  He  would  like  to  manifest  his  pity, 
his  tenderness,  his  devotion,  but — who  would  think  it  of  an 
advocate? — he  is  extraordinarily  awkward  at  expressing  him- 
self— or  perhaps  he  becomes  'awkward  precisely  when  his  feel- 
ings are  sincere.  He  kisses  his  father.  The  way  in  which  he 
lays  his  head  upon  his  shoulder,  and  leans  and  lingers  there, 
convinces  Profitendieu  that  his  son  has  understood.  He  has 
understood  so  thoroughly  that,  raising  his  head  a  little,  he  asks 
in  his  usual  clumsy  fashion — but  his  heart  is  so  anxious  that 
he  cannot  refrain  from  asking: 

"And  Caloub?" 

The  question  is  absurd,  for  Caloub's  looks  are  as  strikingly 
like  his  family's  as  Bernard's  are  different. 

Profitendieu  pats  Charles  on  the  shoulder: 

"No,  no;  it's  all  right.  Only  Bernard." 

Then  Charles  begins  pompously: 

"God  has  driven  the  intruder  away  .  .  ." 

But  Profitendieu  stops  him.  He  has  no  need  of  such  words. 

"Hush!" 

Father  and  son  have  no  more  to  say  to  each  other.  Let  us 
leave  them.  It  is  nearly  eleven  o'clock.  Let  us  leave  Madame 
Profitendieu  in  her  room,  seated  on  a  small,  straight,  un- 
comfortable chair.  She  is  not  crying;  she  is  not  thinking.  She 
too  would  like  to  run  away.  But  she  will  not.  When  she  was 
with  her  lover — Bernard's  father  (we  need  not  concern  our- 
selves with  him) — she  said  to  herself:  "No,  no;  try  as  I  may. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  22 

I  shall  never  be  anything  but  an  honest  woman."  She  was 
afraid  of  liberty,  of  crime,  of  ease — so  that  after  ten  days, 
she  returned  repentant  to  her  home.  Her  parents  were  right 
when  they  said  to  her:  "You  never  know  your  own  mind." 
Let  us  leave  her.  Cecile  is  already  asleep.  Caloub  is  gazing 
in  despair  at  his  candle;  it  will  never  last  long  enough  for  him 
to  finish  the  story-book,  with  which  he  is  distracting  himself 
from  thoughts  of  Bernard.  I  should  be  curious  to  know  what 
Antoine  can  have  told  his  friend  the  cook.  But  it  is  impossible 
to  listen  to  everything.  This  is  the  hour  appointed  for  Bernard 
to  go  to  Olivier.  I  am  not  sure  where  he  dined  that  evening — 
or  even  whether  he  dined  at  all.  He  has  passed  the  porter's 
room  without  hindrance;  he  gropes  his  way  stealthily  up  the 
stairs.  .  .  . 


Ill 

BERNARD  AND  OLIVIER 

"Plenty  and  peace  breeds  cowards;  hardness 

ever 
Of  hardiness  is  mother." 

Cymbeline,  Act   III,   Sc.  VI. 

Olivier  had  got  into  bed  to  receive  his  mother,  who  was  in 
the  habit  of  coming  every  evening  to  kiss  her  two  younger 
sons  good-night  before  they  went  to  sleep.  He  might  have  got 
up  and  dressed  again  to  receive  Bernard,  but  he  was  still  un- 
certain whether  he  would  come  and  was  afraid  of  doing  any- 
thing to  rouse  his  younger  brother's  suspicions.  George  as  a 
rule  went  to  sleep  early  and  woke  up  late;  perhaps  he  would 
never  notice  that  anything  unusual  was  going  on.  When  he 
heard  a  gentle  scratching  outside,  Olivier  sprang  from  his 
bed,  thrust  his  feet  hastily  into  his  bedroom  slippers,  and  ran 
to  open  the  door.  He  did  not  light  a  candle;  the  moon  gave 
light  enough;  there  was  no  need  for  any  other.  Olivier  hugged 
Bernard  in  his  arms: 

"How  I  was  longing  for  you!  I  couldn't  believe  you  would 
really  come,"  said  Olivier,  and  in  the  dimness  he  saw  Bernard 
shrug  his  shoulders.  "Do  your  parents  know  you  are  not  sleep- 
ing at  home  to-night?" 

Bernard  looked  straight  in  front  of  him  into  the  dark. 

"You  think  I  ought  to  have  asked  their  leave,  eh?" 

His  tone  of  voice  was  so  coldly  ironical  that  Olivier  at  once 
felt  the  absurdity  of  his  question.  He  had  not  yet  grasped  that 
Bernard  had  left  "for  good";  he  thought  that  he  only  meant 
to  sleep  out  that  one  night  and  was  a  little  perplexed  as  to  the 
reason  of  this  escapade.  He  began  to  question:  When  did 
Bernard  think  of  going  home? — Never! 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  24 

Light  began  to  dawn  on  Olivier.  He  was  very  anxious  to 
be  equal  to  the  occasion  and  not  to  be  surprised  at  anything; 
nevertheless  an  exclamation  broke  from  him: 

"What  a  tremendous  decision!" 

Bernard  was  by  no  means  unwilling  to  astonish  his  friend 
a  little;  he  was  particularly  flattered  by  the  admiration  which 
these  words  betrayed,  but  he  shrugged  his  shoulders  once  more. 
Olivier  took  hold  of  his  hand  and  asked  very  gravely  and 
anxiously: 

"But  why  are  you  leaving?" 

"That,  my  dear  fellow,  is  a  family  matter.  I  can't  tell  you." 
And  in  order  not  to  seem  too  serious  he  amused  himself  by 
trying  to  jerk  off  with  the  tip  of  his  shoe  the  slipper  that 
Olivier  was  swinging  on  his  bare  toes — for  they  were  sitting 
down  now  on  the  side  of  the  bed.  There!  Off  it  goes! 

"Then  where  do  you  mean  to  live?" 

"I  don't  know." 

"And  how?" 

"That  remains  to  be  seen." 

"Have  you  any  money?" 

"Enough  for  breakfast  to-morrow." 

"And  after  that?" 

"After  that  I  shall  look  about  me.  Oh,  I'm  sure  to  find  some- 
thing. You'll  see.  I'll  let  you  know." 

Olivier  admires  his  friend  with  immense  fervour.  He  knows 
him  to  be  resolute;  but  he  cannot  help  doubting;  when  he  is 
at  the  end  of  his  resources,  and  feeling,  as  soon  he  must,  the 
pressure  of  want,  won't  he  be  obliged  to  go  back?  Bernard 
reassures  him — he  will  do  anything  in  the  world  rather  than 
return  to  his  people.  And  as  he  repeats  several  times  over 
more  and  more  savagely — "anything  in  the  world!" — Olivier's 
heart  is  stabbed  with  a  pang  of  terror.  He  wants  to  speak  but 
dares  not.  At  last  with  downcast  head  and  unsteady  voice,  he 
begins: 

"Bernard,  all  the  same,  you're  not  thinking  of  .  .  ."  but  he 
stops.  His  friend  raises  his  eyes  and,  though  he  cannot  see  him 
very  distinctly,  perceives  his  confusion. 


25  BERNARD  AND  OLIVIER 

"Of  what?"  he  asks.  "What  do  you  mean?  Tell  me.  Of 
stealing?" 

Olivier  shakes  his  head.  No,  that's  not  it!  Suddenly  he  bursts 
into  tears  and  clasping  Bernard  convulsively  in  his  arms: 

"Promise  me  that  you  won't  .  .  ." 

Bernard  kisses  him,  then  pushes  him  away  laughing.  He 
has  understood. 

"Oh!  yes!  I  promise  .  .  .  But  all  the  same  you  must  admit 
it  would  be  the  easiest  way  out."  But  Olivier  feels  reassured; 
he  knows  that  these  last  words  are  an  aflfectation  of  cynicism. 

"Your  exam?" 

"Yes;  that's  rather  a  bore.  I  don't  want  to  be  ploughed.  I 
think  I'm  ready  all  right.  It's  more  a  question  of  feeling  fit  on 
the  day.  I  must  manage  to  get  something  fixed  up  very  quickly. 
It's  touch  and  go;  but  I  shall  manage.  You'll  see." 

They  sit  for  a  moment  in  silence.  The  second  slipper  has 
fallen. 

Then  Bernard:  "You'll  catch  cold.  Get  back  into  bed." 

"No;  you  must  get  into  bed." 

"You're  joking.  Come  along!  quick!"  and  he  forces  Olivier  to 
get  into  the  bed  which  he  has  already  lain  down  in  and  which 
is  all  tumbled. 

"But  you?  Where  are  you  going  to  sleep?" 

"Anywhere.  On  the  floor.  In  a  corner.  I  must  get  accustomed 
to  roughing  it." 

"No.  Look  here!  I  want  to  tell  you  something,  but  I  shan't  be 
able  to  unless  I  feel  you  close  to  me.  Get  into  my  bed."  And 
when  Bernard,  after  undressing  himself  in  a  twinkling,  has  got 
in  beside  him: 

"You  know  ,  .  .  what  I  told  you  the  other  day  .  .  .  well, 
it's  come  off.  I  went." 

There  was  no  need  to  say  more  for  Bernard  to  understand. 
He  pressed  up  against  his  friend. 

"Well !  it's  disgusting  .  .  .  horrible  .  .  .  Aftenvards  I  wanted 
to  spit — to  be  sick — to  tear  my  skin  off — to  kill  myself." 

"You're  exaggerating." 

"To  kill  her." 

"Who  was  it?  You  haven't  been  imprudent,  have  you?" 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  26 

"No;  it's  some  creature  Dhurmer  knows.  He  introduced  me. 
It  was  her  talk  that  was  the  most  loathsome.  She  never  once 
stopped  jabbering.  And  oh!  the  deadly  stupidity  of  it!  Why 
can't  people  hold  their  tongues  at  such  moments,  I  wonder?  I 
should  have  liked  to  strangle  her — to  gag  her." 

"Poor  old  Olivier!  You  didn't  think  that  Dhurmer  could  get 
hold  of  anybody  but  an  idiot,  did  you?  Was  she  pretty,  any- 
way?" 

"D'you  suppose  I  looked  at  her?" 

"You're  a  donkey!  You're  a  darling!  .  .  .  Let's  go  to  sleep. 
.  .  .  But  .  .  .  did  you  bring  it  off  all  right?" 

"God!  That's  the  most  disgusting  thing  about  it.  1  was  able 
to,  in  spite  of  everything  .  .  .  just  as  if  I'd  desired  her." 

"Well,  it's  magnificent,  my  dear  boy." 

"Oh,  shut  up!  If  that's  what  they  call  love — I'm  fed  up 
with  it." 

"What  a  baby  you  are!" 

"What  would  you  have  been,  pray?" 

"Oh,  you  know,  I'm  not  particularly  keen;  as  I've  told  you 
before,  I'm  biding  my  time.  In  cold  blood,  like  that,  it  doesn't 
appeal  to  me.  All  the  same  if  I " 

"If  you  .  .  .  ?" 

"If  she  .  .  .  Nothing!  Let's  go  to  sleep." 

And  abruptly  he  turns  his  back,  drawing  a  little  away  so  as 
not  to  touch  Olivier's  body,  which  he  feels  uncomfortably  warm. 
But  Olivier,  after  a  moment's  silence,  begins  again: 

"I  say,  do  you  think  Barres  will  get  in?" 

"Heavens!  does  that  worry  you?" 

"I  don't  care  a  damn!  I  say,  just  listen  to  this  a  minute."  He 
presses  on  Bernard's  shoulder,  so  as  to  make  him  turn  round — 
"My  brother  has  got  a  mistress." 

"George?" 

The  youngster,  who  is  pretending  to  be  asleep,  but  who  has 
been  listening  with  all  his  might  in  the  dark,  holds  his  breath 
when  he  hears  his  name. 

"You're  crazy.  I  mean  Vincent."  (Vincent  is  a  few  years 
older  than  Olivier  and  has  just  finished  his  medical  training.) 


27  BERNARD  AND  OLIVIER 

"Did  he  tell  you?" 

"No.  I  found  out  without  his  suspecting.  My  parents  know 
nothing  about  it." 

"What  would  they  say  if  they  knew?" 

"I  don't  know.  Mamma  would  be  in  despair.  Papa  would  say 
he  must  break  it  off  or  else  marry  her." 

"Of  course.  A  worthy  bourgeois  can't  understand  how  one 
can  be  worthy  in  any  other  fashion  than  his  own.  How  did  you 
find  out?" 

"Well,  for  some  time  past  Vincent  has  been  going  out  at  night 
after  my  parents  have  gone  to  bed.  He  goes  downstairs  as  quietly 
as  he  can,  but  I  recognize  his  step  in  the  street.  Last  week — 
Tuesday,  I  think,  the  night  was  so  hot  I  couldn't  stop  in  bed. 
I  went  to  the  window  to  get  a  breath  of  fresh  air.  I  heard  the 
door  downstairs  open  and  shut,  so  I  leant  out  and,  as  he  was 
passing  under  a  lamp  post,  I  recognized  Vincent.  It  was  past 
midnight.  That  was  the  first  time — I  mean  the  first  time  I  no- 
ticed anything.  But  since  then,  I  can't  help  listening — oh! 
without  meaning  to — and  nearly  every  night  I  hear  him  go  out. 
He's  got  a  latchkey  and  our  parents  have  arranged  our  old 
room — George's  and  mine — as  a  consulting  room  for  him  when 
he  has  any  patients.  His  room  is  by  itself  on  the  left  of  the 
entrance;  the  rest  of  our  rooms  are  on  the  right.  He  can  go 
out  and  come  in  without  anyone  knowing.  As  a  rule  I  don't 
hear  him  come  in,  but  the  day  before  yesterday — Monday  night 
— I  don't  know  what  was  the  matter  with  me — 1  was  thinking  of 
Dhurmer's  scheme  for  a  review  ...  I  couldn't  go  to  sleep.  I 
heard  voices  on  the  stairs.  I  thought  it  was  Vincent." 

"What  time  was  it?"  asks  Bernard,  more  to  show  that  he  is 
taking  an  interest  than  because  he  wants  to  know. 

"Three  in  the  morning,  I  think.  I  got  up  and  put  my  ear 
to  the  door.  Vincent  was  talking  to  a  woman.  Or  rather,  it  was 
she  who  was  talking." 

"Then  how  did  you  know  it  was  he?  All  the  people  who  live 
in  the  flat  must  pass  by  your  door." 

"And  a  horrid  nuisance  it  is,  too.  The  later  it  is,  the  more  row 
they  make.  They  care  no  more  about  the  people  who  are  asleep 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  28 

than  ...  It  was  certainly  he.  I  heard  the  woman  calling  him 
by  his  name.  She  kept  saying  ,  .  .  Oh,  I  can't  bear  repeating 
it.  It  makes  me  sick.  .  .  ." 

"Go  on." 

"She  kept  saying:  'Vincent,  my  love — my  lover  .  .  .  Oh, 
don't  leave  me!' " 

"Did  she  say  you  to  him  and  not  thou?" 

"Yes;  isn't  it  odd?" 

"Tell  us  some  more." 

"  'You  have  no  right  to  desert  me  now.  What  is  to  become  of 
me?  Where  am  1  to  go?  Say  something  to  me!  Oh,  speak  to  me!' 
.  .  .  And  she  called  him  again  by  his  name,  and  went  on  re- 
peating: 'My  lover!  My  lover!'  And  her  voice  became  sadder 
and  sadder  and  lower  and  lower.  And  then  I  heard  a  noise 
(they  must  have  been  standing  on  the  stairs),  a  noise  like  some- 
thing falling.  I  think  she  must  have  flung  herself  on  her  knees." 

"And  didn't  he  answer  anything?  Nothing  at  all?" 

"He  must  have  gone  up  the  last  steps;  I  heard  the  door  of 
the  flat  shut.  And  after  that,  she  stayed  a  long  time  quite  near 
— almost  up  against  my  door.  I  heard  her  sobbing." 

"You  should  have  opened  the  door." 

"I  didn't  dare.  Vincent  would  be  furious  if  he  thought  I  knew 
anything  about  his  affairs.  And  then  I  was  afraid  it  might 
embarrass  her  to  be  found  crying.  I  don't  know  what  I  could 
have  said  to  her." 

Bernard  had  turned  towards  Olivier: 

"In  your  place  I  should  have  opened." 

"Oh,  you!  You're  never  afraid  of  anything.  You  do  every- 
thing that  comes  into  your  head." 

"Is  that  a  reproach?" 

"Oh,  no.  It's  envy." 

"Have  you  any  idea  who  the  woman  is?" 

"How  on  earth  should  I  know?  Good-night." 

"I  say,  are  you  sure  George  hasn't  heard  us?"  whispers  Ber- 
nard in  Olivier's  ear.  They  listen  a  moment  with  bated  breath. 

"No,"  Olivier  goes  on  in  his  ordinary  voice,  "He's  asleep. 
And  besides,  he  wouldn't  understand.  Do  you  know  what  he 
asked  Papa  the  other  day  .  .  .  ?" 


29  BERNARD  AND  OLIVIER 

At  this,  George  can  contain  himself  no  longer.  He  sits  up  in 
his  bed  and  breaks  into  his  brother's  sentence. 

"You  ass!"  he  cries.  "Didn't  you  see  I  was  doing  it  on  pur- 
pose? .  .  .  Good  Lord,  yes!  I've  heard  every  word  you've  been 
saying.  But  you  needn't  excite  yourselves.  I've  known  all  about 
Vincent  for  ever  so  long.  And  now,  my  young  friends,  talk  a 
little  lower  please,  because  I'm  sleepy — or  else  hold  your 
tongues." 

Olivier  turns  toward  the  wall.  Bernard,  who  cannot  sleep, 
looks  out  into  the  room.  It  seems  bigger  in  the  moonlight.  As 
a  matter  of  fact,  he  hardly  knows  it.  Olivier  was  never  there 
during  the  daytime;  the  few  times  that  Bernard  had  been  to 
see  him,  it  was  in  the  flat  upstairs.  But  it  was  after  school  hours, 
when  they  came  out  of  the  lycee,  that  the  two  friends  usually 
met.  The  moonlight  has  reached  the  foot  of  the  bed  in  which 
George  has  at  last  gone  to  sleep;  he  has  heard  almost  every- 
thing that  his  brother  has  said.  He  has  matter  for  his  dreams. 
Above  George's  bed  Bernard  can  just  make  out  a  little  book- 
case with  two  shelves  full  of  school-books.  On  a  table  near 
Olivier's  bed,  he  sees  a  larger  sized  book;  he  puts  out  his  hand 
and  takes  it  to  look  at  the  title — Tocqueville;  but  as  he  is 
putting  it  back  on  the  table,  he  drops  it  and  the  noise  wakes 
Olivier  up. 

"Are  you  reading  Tocqueville  now?" 

"Dulac  lent  it  me." 

"Do  you  like  it?" 

"It's  rather  boring,  but  some  of  it's  very  good." 

"I  say,  what  are  you  doing  to-morrow?" 

To-morrow  is  Thursday  and  there  is  no  school.  Bernard 
thinks  he  may  meet  his  friend  somewhere.  He  does  not  mean 
to  go  back  to  the  lycee;  he  thinks  he  can  do  without  the  last 
lectures  and  finish  preparing  for  his  examination  by  himself. 

"To-morrow,"  says  Olivier,  "I'm  going  to  St.  Lazare  railway 
station  at  11.30  to  meet  my  Uncle  Edouard,  who  is  arriving 
from  Le  Havre,  on  his  way  from  England.  In  the  afternoon, 
I'm  engaged  to  go  to  the  Louvre  with  Dhurmer.  The  rest  of  the 
time  I've  got  to  work." 

"Your  Uncle  Edouard?" 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  30 

"Yes.  He's  a  half  brother  of  Mamma's.  He's  been  away  for 
six  months  and  I  hardly  know  him;  but  1  like  him  very  much. 
He  doesn't  know  I'm  going  to  meet  him  and  I'm  rather  afraid 
I  mayn't  recognize  him.  He's  not  in  the  least  like  the  rest  of  the 
family;  he's  somebody  quite  out  of  the  common." 

"What  does  he  do?" 

"He  writes.  I've  read  nearly  all  his  books;  but  he  hasn't  pub- 
lished anything  for  a  long  time." 

"Novels?" 

"Yes;  kind  of  novels." 

"Why  have  you  never  told  me  about  them?" 

"Because  you'd  have  wanted  to  read  them;  and  if  you  hadn't 
liked  them  .  .  ." 

"Well,  finish  your  sentence." 

"Well,  I  should  have  hated  it.  There!" 

"What  makes  you  say  that  he's  out  of  the  common?" 

"I  don't  exactly  know.  I  told  you  1  hardly  know  him.  It's 
more  of  a  presentiment.  I  feel  that  he's  interested  in  all  sorts 
of  things  that  don't  interest  my  parents  and  that  there's  nothing 
that  one  couldn't  talk  to  him  about.  One  day — it  was  just  be- 
fore he  went  away — he  had  been  to  lunch  with  us;  all  the  time 
he  was  talking  to  Papa  I  felt  he  kept  looking  at  me  and  it  began 
to  make  me  uncomfortable;  I  was  going  to  leave  the  room — 
it  was  the  dining-room — where  we  had  stayed  on  after  coffee, 
but  then  he  began  to  question  Papa  about  me,  which  made  me 
more  uncomfortable  than  ever;  and  suddenly  Papa  got  up  and 
went  to  fetch  some  verses  I  had  written  and  which  I  had  been 
idiotic  enough  to  show  him." 

"Verses  of  yours?" 

"Yes;  you  know — that  poem  you  said  you  thought  was  like 
Le  Balcon.  I  knew  it  wasn't  any  good — or  hardly  any — and  I 
was  furious  with  Papa  for  bringing  it  out.  For  a  minute  or  two, 
while  Papa  was  fetching  the  poem,  we  were  alone  together. 
Uncle  Edouard  and  1,  and  I  felt  myself  blushing  horribly.  I 
couldn't  think  of  anything  to  say  to  him.  1  looked  away — so  did 
he,  for  that  matter;  he  began  by  rolling  a  cigarette  and  lighting 
it  and  then  to  put  me  at  my  ease,  no  doubt,  for  he  certainly  saw 
I  was  blushing,  he  got  up  and  went  and  looked  out  of  the 


31  BERNARD  AND  OLIVIER 

window.  He  was  whistling.  Then  he  suddenly  said,  'I  feel  far 
more  embarrassed  than  you  do,  you  know.'  But  I  think  it  was 
just  kindness.  At  last  Papa  came  back  again;  he  handed  my 
verses  to  Uncle  Edouard,  and  he  began  to  read  them.  I  was  in 
such  a  state  that  I  think  if  he  had  paid  me  compliments,  I 
should  have  insulted  him.  Evidently  Papa  expected  him  to — 
pay  me  compliments — and  as  my  uncle  said  nothing,  he  asked 
him  what  he  thought  of  them.  But  Uncle  Edouard  answered 
him,  laughing,  'I  can't  speak  to  him  comfortably  about  them  be- 
fore you.'  Then  Papa  laughed  too  and  went  out.  And  when  we 
were  alone  again,  he  said  he  thought  my  verses  were  very  bad, 
but  I  liked  hearing  him  say  so;  and  what  I  liked  still  more  was 
that  suddenly  he  put  his  finger  down  on  two  lines — the  only  two 
I  cared  for  in  the  whole  thing;  he  looked  at  me  and  said.  That's 
good!'  Wasn't  it  nice?  And  if  you  only  knew  the  tone  in  which 
he  said  it!  I  could  have  hugged  him.  Then  he  said  my  mistake 
was  to  start  from  an  idea,  and  that  I  didn't  allow  myself  to  be 
guided  sufficiently  by  the  words.  I  didn't  understand  very  well 
at  first;  but  I  think  I  see  now  what  he  meant — and  that  he  was 
right.  I'll  explain  it  to  you  another  time." 

"I  understand  now  why  you  want  to  go  and  meet  him." 
"Oh,  all  that's  nothing  and  I  don't  know  why  I've  told  you 
about  it.  We  said  a  great  deal  more  to  one  another." 

"At  11.30  did  you  say?  How  do  you  know  he's  coming  by 
that  train?" 

"Because  he  wrote  and  told  Mamma  on  a  post-card;  and  then 
I  looked  it  up  in  the  time-table." 
"Will  you  have  lunch  with  him?" 

"Oh,  no.  I  must  be  back  here  by  twelve,  I  shall  just  have 
time  to  shake  hands  with  him.  But  that's  enough  for  me.  .  .  . 
Oh,  one  thing  more  before  I  go  to  sleep.  When  shall  I  see  you 
again?" 
"Not  for  some  days.  Not  before  I've  got  something  fixed  up." 
"All  the  same  .  .  .  Couldn't  I  help  you  somehow  .  .  .  ?" 
"You?  Help  me?  No.  It  wouldn't  be  fair  play.  I  should  feel 
as  if  I  were  cheating.  Good-night." 


VINCENT  AND  THE  COMTE  DE  PASSAVANT 

Mon  pere  etait  une  bete,  mais  ma  mere 
avatt  de  I'esprit;  elle  etait  quietiste;  c'etait 
une  petite  femme  douce  qui  vie  disait  souvent: 
Mon  fils,  vous  serei  damne.  Mais  cela  ne  lui 
faisait  pas  de  peine. 

FONTENELLE.    . 

No,  it  was  not  to  see  his  mistress  that  Vincent  Molinier  went 
out  every  evening.  Quickly  as  he  walks,  let  us  follow  him.  He 
goes  along  the  Rue  Notre  Dame  des  Champs,  at  the  further 
end  of  which  he  lives,  until  he  reaches  the  Rue  Placide,  which 
is  its  prolongation;  then  he  turns  down  the  Rue  du  Bac,  where 
there  are  still  a  few  belated  passers-by.  In  the  Rue  de  Babylone, 
he  stops  in  front  of  a  porte-cochere  which  swings  open  to  let 
him  in.  The  Comte  de  Passavant  lives  here.  If  Vincent  were 
not  in  the  habit  of  coming  often,  he  would  enter  this  sumptuous 
mansion  with  a  less  confident  air.  The  footman  who  comes  to 
the  door  knows  well  enough  how  much  timidity  this  feigned 
assurance  hides.  Vincent,  with  a  touch  of  affectation,  instead  of 
handing  him  his  hat,  tosses  it  on  to  an  arm-chair.  ■ 

It  is  only  recently  that  Vincent  has  taken  to  coming  here. 
Robert  de  Passavant,  who  now  calls  himself  his  friend,  is  the 
friend  of  a  great  many  people.  I  am  not  very  sure  how  he  and 
Vincent  became  acquainted.  At  the  lycee,  I  expect — though 
Robert  de  Passavant  is  perceptibly  older  than  Vincent;  they  had 
lost  sight  of  each  other  for  several  years  and  then,  quite  lately, 
had  met  again  one  evening  when,  by  some  unusual  chance, 
Olivier  had  gone  with  his  brother  to  the  theatre;  during  the 
entr'acte  Passavant  had  invited  them  both  to  take  an  ice  with 
him;  he  had  learnt  that  Vincent  had  just  finished  his  last  medi- 
cal examinations  and  was  undecided  as  to  whether  he  should 


33  VINCENT  AND   PASSAVANT 

take  a  place  as  house  physician  in  a  hospital;  science  attracted 
him  more  than  medicine,  but  the  necessity  of  earning  his  living 
...  in  short,  Vincent  accepted  with  pleasure  the  very  remu- 
nerative offer  Robert  de  Passavant  had  made  him  a  little  later 
of  coming  every  evening,  to  attend  his  old  father,  who  had 
lately  undergone  a  very  serious  operation;  it  was  a  matter  of 
bandages,  of  injections,  of  soundings — in  fact,  of  whatever  deli- 
cate services  you  please,  which  necessitate  the  ministrations  of 
an  expert  hand. 

But,  added  to  this,  the  Vicomte  had  secret  reasons  for  wish- 
ing a  nearer  acquaintance  with  Vincent;  and  Vincent  had  still 
others  for  consenting.  Robert's  secret  reason  we  shall  try  to  dis- 
cover later  on.  As  for  Vincent's— it  was  this:  he  was  urgently 
in  need  of  money.  When  your  heart  is  in  the  right  place  and 
a  wholesome  education  has  early  instilled  into  you  a  sense  of 
your  responsibilities,  you  don't  get  a  woman  with  child,  with- 
out feeling  yourself  more  or  less  bound  to  her — especially  when 
the  woman  has  left  her  husband  to  follow  you. 

Up  till  then,  Vincent  had  lived  on  the  whole  virtuously.  His 
adventure  with  Laura  appeared  to  him  alternately,  according 
to  the  moment  of  the  day  in  which  he  thought  of  it,  as  either 
monstrous  or  perfectly  natural.  It  very  often  suffices  to  add  to- 
gether a  quantity  of  little  facts  which,  taken  separately,  are  very 
simple  and  very  natural,  to  arrive  at  a  sum  which  is  monstrous. 
He  said  all  this  to  himself  over  and  over  again  as  he  walked 
along,  but  it  didn't  get  him  out  of  his  difficulties.  No  doubt,  he 
had  never  thought  of  taking  this  woman  permanently  under  his 
protection — of  marrying  her  after  a  divorce,  or  of  living  with 
her  without  marrying;  he  was  obliged  to  confess  to  himself  that 
he  had  no  very  violent  passion  for  her;  but  he  knew  she  was  in 
Paris  without  means  of  subsistence;  he  was  the  cause  of  her 
distress;  at  the  very  least  he  owed  her  that  first  precarious  aid 
which  he  felt  himself  less  and  less  able  to  give  her — less  to-day 
than  yesterday.  For  last  week  he  still  possessed  the  five  thou- 
sand francs  which  his  mother  had  patiently  and  laboriously 
saved  to  give  him  a  start  in  his  profession;  those  five  thousand 
francs  would  have  sufficed,  no  doubt,  to  pay  for  his  mistress's 
confinement,  for  her  stay  in  a  nursing  home,  for  the  child's  first 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  34 

necessaries.  To  what  demon's  advice  then  had  he  listened? 
What  demon  had  hinted  to  him  one  evening  that  this  sum 
which  he  had  as  good  as  given  to  Laura,  which  he  had  laid  by 
for  her,  pledged  to  her — that  this  sum  would  be  insufficient? 
No,  it  was  not  Robert  de  Passavant;  Robert  had  never  said 
anything  of  the  kind;  but  his  proposal  to  take  Vincent  with  him 
to  a  gambling  club  fell  out  precisely  the  same  evening.  And 
Vincent  had  accepted. 

The  hell  in  question  was  a  particularly  treacherous  one,  in- 
asmuch as  the  habitues  were  all  people  in  society  and  the  whole 
thing  took  place  on  a  friendly  footing.  Robert  introduced  his 
friend  Vincent  to  one  and  another.  Vincent,  who  was  taken 
unawares,  was  not  able  to  play  high  that  first  evening.  He  had 
hardly  anything  on  him  and  refused  the  notes  which  the  Vi- 
comte  offered  to  advance  him.  But  as  he  began  by  winning,  he 
regretted  not  being  able  to  stake  more  and  promised  to  go  back 
the  next  night. 

"Everybody  knows  you  now;  there's  no  need  for  me  to  come 
with  you  again,"  said  Robert. 

These  meetings  took  place  at  Pierre  de  Brouville's,  commonly 
known  as  Pedro.  After  this  first  evening  Robert  de  Passavant 
had  put  his  car  at  his  friend's  disposal.  Vincent  used  to  look 
in  about  eleven  o'clock,  smoke  a  cigarette  with  Robert,  and 
after  chatting  for  ten  minutes  or  so,  go  upstairs.  His  stay  there 
was  more  or  less  lengthy  according  to  the  Count's  patience, 
temper  or  requirements;  after  this  he  drove  in  the  car  to 
Pedro's  in  the  Rue  St.  Florentin,  whence  about  an  hour  later 
the  car  took  him  back — not  actually  to  his  own  door,  for  he 
was  afraid  of  attracting  attention,  but  to  the  nearest  corner. 

The  night  before  last,  Laura  Douviers,  seated  on  the  steps 
which  led  to  the  Moliniers'  flat,  had  waited  for  Vincent  till 
three  o'clock  in  the  morning;  it  was  not  till  then  that  he  had 
come  in.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  Vincent  had  not  been  at  Pedro's 
that  night.  Two  days  had  gone  by  since  he  had  lost  every  penny 
of  the  five  thousand  francs.  He  had  informed  Laura  of  this; 
he  had  written  that  he  could  do  nothing  more  for  her;  that  he 
advised  her  to  go  back  to  her  husband  or  her  father — to  confess 
everything.  But  things  had  gone  so  far,  that  confession  seemed 


35  VINCENT  AND   PASSAVANT 

impossible  to  Laura  and  she  could  not  contemplate  it  with  any 
sort  of  calm.  Her  lover's  objurgations  merely  aroused  indigna- 
tion in  her — an  indignation  which  only  subsided  to  leave  her  a 
prey  to  despair.  This  was  the  state  in  which  Vincent  had  found 
her.  She  had  tried  to  keep  him;  he  had  torn  himself  from  her 
grasp.  Doubtless,  he  had  to  steel  himself  to  do  it,  for  he  had  a 
tender  heart;  but  he  was  more  of  a  pleasure-seeker  than  a  lover 
and  he  had  easily  persuaded  himself  that  duty  itself  demanded 
harshness.  He  had  answered  nothing  to  all  her  entreaties  and 
lamentations,  and  as  Olivier,  who  had  heard  them,  told  Bernard 
afterwards,  when  Vincent  shut  the  door  against  her,  she  had 
sunk  down  on  the  steps  and  remained  for  a  long  time  sobbing 
in  the  dark. 

More  than  forty  hours  had  gone  by  since  that  night.  The 
day  before,  Vincent  had  not  gone  to  Robert  de  Passavant's, 
whose  father  seemed  to  be  recovering;  but  that  evening  a  tele- 
gram had  summoned  him.  Robert  wished  to  see  him.  When  Vin- 
cent entered  the  room  in  which  Robert  usually  sat — a  room 
which  he  used  as  his  study  and  smoking-room  and  which  he 
had  been  at  some  pains  to  decorate  and  fit  up  in  his  own 
fashion — Robert  carelessly  held  out  his  hand  to  him  over  his 
shoulder,  without  rising. 

Robert  is  writing.  He  is  sitting  at  a  bureau  littered  with 
books.  Facing  him  the  French  window  which  gives  on  to  the 
garden,  stands  wide  open  in  the  moonlight.  He  speaks  without 
turning  round. 

"Do  you  know  what  I  am  writing?  But  you  won't  mention 
it,  will  you?  You  promise,  eh? — a  manifesto  for  the  opening 
number  of  Dhurmer's  review.  I  shan't  sign  it,  of  course — espe- 
cially as  I  puff  myself  in  it.  .  .  .  And  then  as  it'll  certainly 
come  out  in  the  long  run  that  I'm  financing  it,  I  don't  want  it 
known  too  soon  that  I  write  for  it.  So  mum's  the  word!  But 
it's  just  occurred  to  me — didn't  you  say  that  young  brother  of 
yours  wrote?  What's  his  name  again?" 

"Olivier,"  says  Vincent. 

"Olivier!  Yes;  I  had  forgotten.  Don't  stay  standing  there  like 
that!  Sit  down  in  that  arm-chair.  You're  not  cold?  Shall  I  shut 
the  window?  .  .  .  It's  poetry  he  writes,  isn't  it?  He  ought  to 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  36 

bring  me  something  to  see.  Of  course,  I  don't  promise  to  take 
it.  .  .  .  But,  all  the  same,  I  should  be  surprised  if  it  were  bad. 
He  looks  an  intelligent  boy.  And  then  he's  obviously  au  courant. 
I  should  like  to  talk  to  him.  Tell  him  to  come  and  see  me,  eh? 
Mind,  I  count  on  it.  A  cigarette?"  And  he  holds  out  his  silver 
cigarette-case. 

"With  pleasure." 

"Now  then,  Vincent,  listen  to  me.  I  must  speak  to  you  very 
seriously.  You  behaved  like  a  child  the  other  evening  ...  so 
did  I,  for  that  matter.  I  don't  say  it  was  wrong  of  me  to  take 
you  to  Pedro's,  but  I  feel  responsible,  a  little,  for  the  money 
you've  lost.  I  don't  know  if  that's  what's  meant  by  remorse, 
but,  upon  my  word,  it's  beginning  to  disturb  my  sleep  and  my 
digestion.  And  then,  when  I  think  of  that  unhappy  woman  you 
told  me  about  .  .  .  But  that's  another  story.  We  won't  speak 
of  that.  It's  sacred.  What  I  want  to  say  is  this — that  I  wish — 
yes,  I'm  absolutely  determined  to  put  at  your  disposal  a  sum 
of  money  equivalent  to  what  you've  lost.  It  was  five  thousand 
francs,  wasn't  it?  And  you're  to  risk  it  again.  Once  more,  I  re- 
peat, I  consider  myself  the  cause  of  your  losing  this  money — 
I  owe  it  to  you — there's  no  need  to  thank  me.  You'll  pay  me 
back  if  you  win.  If  not — worse  luck!  We  shall  be  quits.  Go 
back  to  Pedro's  this  evening,  as  if  nothing  had  happened.  The 
car  will  take  you  there;  then  it'll  come  back  here  to  take 
me  to  Lady  GrifTith's,  where  I'll  ask  you  to  join  me  later  on.  I 
count  upon  it,  eh?  The  car  will  fetch  you  from  Pedro's." 

He  opens  a  drawer  and  takes  out  five  notes  which  he  hands 
to  Vincent. 

"Be  off  with  you,  now." 

"But  your  father?" 

"Oh,  yes ;  I  forgot  to  tell  you :  he  died  about  .  .  ."  He  pulls 
out  his  watch  and  exclaims:  "By  Jove!  how  late  it  is!  Nearly 
midnight.  .  .  .  You  must  make  haste.  Yes,  about  four  hours 
ago." 

All  this  is  said  without  any  quickening  of  his  voice,  on  the 
contrary  with  a  kind  of  nonchalance. 

"And  aren't  you  going  to  stay  to  .  .  ." 

"To  watch  by  the  body?"  interrupts  Robert,  "No,  that's  my 


37  VhNCENT  AND   PASSAVANT 

young  brother's  business.  He  is  up  there  with  his  old  nurse, 
who  was  on  better  terms  with  the  deceased  than  I  was." 
Then  as  Vincent  remains  motionless,  he  goes  on: 
"Look  here,  my  dear  fellow,  I  don't  want  to  appear  cynical, 
but  I  have  a  horror  of  reach-me-down  sentiments.  In  my  early 
days  I  cut  out  my  filial  love  according  to  the  pattern  I  had 
in  my  heart;  but  I  soon  saw  that  my  measurements  had  been 
too  ample,  and  I  was  obliged  to  take  it  in.  The  old  man  never 
in  his  life  occasioned  me  anything  but  trouble  and  vexation 
and  constraint.  If  he  had  any  tenderness  left,  it  was  certainly 
not  to  me  that  he  showed  it.  My  first  impulses  of  affection  to- 
wards him,  in  the  days  before  I  knev/  how  to  behave,  brought 
me  nothing  but  snubs — and  I  learnt  my  lesson.  You  must  have 
seen  for  yourself  when  you  were  attending  him.  .  .  ,  Did  he 
ever  thank  you?  Did  you  ever  get  the  slightest  look,  the  smallest 
smile  from  him?  He  always  thought  everything  his  due.  Oh,  he 
was  what  people  call  a  character!  I  think  he  must  have  made 
my  mother  very  unhappy,  and  yet  he  loved  her — that  is,  if  he 
ever  really  loved  anyone.  I  think  he  made  everyone  who  came 
near  him  suffer — his  servants,  his  dogs,  his  horses,  his  mis- 
tresses; not  his  friends,  for  he  had  none.  A  general  sigh  of 
relief  will  go  up  at  his  death.  He  was,  I  believe,  a  man  of  great 
distinction  in  'his  line,'  as  people  say;  but  I  have  never  been 
able  to  discover  what  it  was.  He  was  very  intelligent,  undoubt- 
edly. At  heart,  I  had — I  still  have — a  certain  admiration  for 
him — but  as  for  making  play  with  a  handkerchief — as  for 
wringing  tears  out  ...  no,  thank  you,  I'm  no  longer  child 
enough  for  that.  Be  off  with  you  now!  And  join  me  in  an  hour's 
time  at  Lilian's.  What!  you're  not  dressed?  Absurd!  What  does 
it  matter?  But  if  it'll  make  you  more  comfortable,  I'll  promise 
not  to  change  either.  Agreed!  Light  a  cigar  before  you  go  and 
send  the  car  back  quickly — it'll  fetch  you  again  afterwards." 
He  watched  Vincent  go  out,  shrugged  his  shoulders,  then 
went  into  his  dressing-room  to  change  into  his  dress  suit,  which 
was  ready  laid  out  for  him  on  a  sofa. 

In  a  room  on  the  first  floor,  the  old  count  is  lying  on  his 
death-bed.  Someone  has  placed  a  crucifix  on  his  breast,  but 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  38 

has  omitted  to  fold  his  hands  over  it,  A  beard  of  some  days' 
growth  softens  the  stubborn  angle  of  his  chin.  Beneath  his  grey 
hair,  which  is  brushed  up  en  hrosse,  the  wrinkles  that  line  his 
forehead  seem  less  deeply  graven,  as  though  they  were  relaxed. 
His  eye  is  sunk  beneath  the  arch  of  the  brow  and  the  shaggy 
growth  of  the  eyebrow.  I  know  that  we  shall  never  see  him 
again,  and  that  is  the  reason  that  I  take  a  long  look  at  him. 
Beside  the  head  of  the  bed  is  an  arm-chair,  in  which  is  seated 
the  old  nurse  Seraphine.  But  she  has  risen.  She  goes  up  to  a 
table  where  an  old-fashioned  lamp  is  dimly  lighting  the  room; 
it  needs  turning  up.  A  lamp-shade  casts  the  light  on  to  the 
book  young  Gontran  is  reading.  .  .  . 

"You're  tired,  Master  Gontran.  You  had  better  go  to  bed." 

The  glance  that  Gontran  raises  from  his  book  to  rest  upon 
Seraphine  is  very  gentle.  His  fair  hair,  a  lock  of  which  he  pushes 
back  from  his  forehead,  waves  loosely  over  his  temples.  He  is 
fifteen  years  old,  and  his  face,  which  is  still  almost  girlish,  ex- 
presses nothing  as  yet  but  tenderness  and  love. 

"And  you?"  he  says.  "It  is  you  who  ought  to  go  to  bed,  you 
poor  old  Fine.  Last  night,  you  were  on  your  feet  nearly  the 
whole  time." 

"Oh,  I'm  accustomed  to  sitting  up.  And  besides  I  slept  during 
the  daytime — but  you  .  .  ." 

"No,  I'm  all  right.  I  don't  feel  tired;  and  it  does  me  good 
to  stay  here  thinking  and  reading.  I  knew  Papa  so  little;  I  think 
I  should  forget  him  altogether  if  I  didn't  take  a  good  look  at 
him  now.  I  will  sit  beside  him  till  daylight.  How  long  is  it,  Fine, 
since  you  came  to  us?" 

"I  came  the  year  before  you  were  born,  and  you're  nearly 
sixteen." 

"Do  you  remember  Mamma  quite  well?" 

"Do  I  remember  your  Mamma?  What  a  question!  You  might 
as  well  ask  me  if  I  remember  my  own  name.  To  be  sure,  I  re- 
member your  Mamma." 

"I  remember  her  too — a  little.  .  .  .  But  not  very  well.  ...  I 
was  only  five  when  she  died.  Used  Papa  to  talk  to  her  much?" 

"It  depended  on  his  mood.  Your  Papa  was  never  a  one  to 
talk  much,  and  he  didn't  care  to  be  spoken  to  first.  All  the  same 


39  VINCENT  AND   PASSAVANT 

in  those  days  he  was  a  little  more  talkative  than  he  has  been 
of  late.  .  .  .  But  there  now!  What's  past  is  past,  and  it's  better 
not  to  stir  it  up  again.  There's  One  above  who's  a  better  judge 
of  these  things  than  we  are." 

"Do  you  really  think  that  He  concerns  Himself  about  such 
things,  dear  Fine?" 

"Why,  if  He  doesn't,  who  should  then?" 

Gontran  puts  his  lips  on  Seraphine's  red,  roughened  hand. 
"You  really  ought  to  go  to  bed  now.  I  promise  to  wake  you 
as  soon  as  it  is  light,  and  then  I'll  take  my  turn  to  rest. 
Please!" 

As  soon  as  Seraphine  has  left  him,  Gontran  falls  upon  his 
knees  at  the  foot  of  the  bed;  he  buries  his  head  in  the  sheets, 
but  he  cannot  succeed  in  weeping.  No  emotion  stirs  his  heart; 
his  eyes  remain  despairingly  dry.  Then  he  gets  up  and  looks 
at  the  impassive  face  on  the  bed.  At  this  solemn  moment,  he 
would  like  to  have  some  rare,  sublime  experience — hear  a  mes- 
sage from  the  world  beyond — send  his  thought  flying  into  ethe- 
real regions,  inaccessible  to  mortal  senses.  But  no!  his  thought 
remains  obstinately  grovelling  on  the  earth;  he  looks  at  the  dead 
man's  bloodless  hands  and  wonders  for  how  much  longer  the 
nails  will  go  on  growing.  The  sight  of  the  unclasped  hands 
grates  on  him.  He  would  like  to  join  them,  to  make  them  hold 
the  crucifix.  What  a  good  idea!  He  thinks  of  Seraphine's  aston- 
ishment when  she  sees  the  dead  hands  folded  together;  the 
thought  of  Seraphine's  astonishment  amuses  him;  and  then  he 
despises  himself  for  being  amused.  Nevertheless  he  stoops  over 
the  bed.  He  seizes  the  arm  which  is  farthest  from  him.  The  arm 
is  stiff  and  will  not  bend.  Gontran  tries  to  force  it,  but  the  whole 
body  moves  with  it.  He  seizes  the  other  arm,  which  seems  a  little 
less  rigid.  Gontran  almost  succeeds  in  putting  the  hand  in  the 
proper  place.  He  takes  the  crucifix  and  tries  to  slip  it  between 
the  fingers  and  the  thumb,  but  the  contact  of  the  cold  flesh 
turns  him  sick.  He  thinks  he  is  going  to  faint.  He  has  a  mind 
to  call  Seraphine  back.  He  gives  up  everything — the  crucifix, 
which  drops  aslant  on  the  tumbled  sheet,  and  the  lifeless  arm, 
which  falls  back  again  into  its  first  position;  then,  through  the 
depths  of  the  funereal  silence,  he  suddenly  hears  a  rough  and 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  40 

brutal  "God  damn!"  which  fills  him  with  terror,  as  if  someone 
else  ...  He  turns  round — but  no!  he  is  alone.  It  was  from 
his  own  lips,  from  his  own  heart,  that  that  resounding  curse 
broke  forth — his,  who  until  to-day  has  never  uttered  an  oath! 
Then  he  sits  down  and  plunges  again  into  his  reading. 


VINCENT   MEETS   PASSAVANT  AT   LADY 
GRIFFITH'S 

C'etait  une   dme   et   un   corps    oh  n'entrait

Sainte-Beuve. 

Lilian  half  sat  up  and  put  the  tips  of  her  fingers  on  Robert's 
chestnut  hair.  "Take  care,  my  dear.  You  are  hardly  thirty  yet 
and  you're  beginning  to  get  thin  on  the  top.  Baldness  wouldn't 
be  at  all  becoming  to  you.  You  take  life  too  seriously." 

Robert  raised  his  face  and  looked  at  her,  smiling.  "Not  when 
I  am  with  you,  I  assure  you." 

"Did  you  tell  Molinier  to  come?" 

"Yes,  as  you  asked  me  to." 

"And  .  .  .  you  lent  him  money?" 

"Five  thousand  francs,  as  I  told  you  .  .  .  and  he'll  lose  it, 
like  the  rest." 

"Why  should  he  lose  it?" 

"He's  bound  to.  I  saw  him  the  first  evening.  He  plays 
anyhow." 

"He's  had  time  to  learn.  .  .  .  Will  you  make  a  bet  that  to- 
night he'll  win?" 

"If  you  like." 

"Oh,  please  don't  take  it  as  a  penance.  I  like  people  to  do 
what  they  do  willingly." 

"Don't  be  cross.  Agreed  then.  If  he  wins,  he'll  pay  the 
money  back  to  you.  But  if  he  loses,  it's  you  who'll  pay  me. 
Is  that  all  right?" 

She  pressed  a  bell. 

"Bring  a  bottle  of  Tokay  and  three  glasses,  please.  .  .  .  And 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  42 

if  he  comes  back  with  the  five  thousand  and  no  more — he  shall 
keep  it,  eh?  If  he  neither  loses  nor  wins.  .  .  ." 

"That's  unheard  of.  It's  odd  what  an  interest  you  take  in 
him." 

"It's  odd  that  you  don't  think  him  interesting." 

"You  think  him  interesting  because  you're  in  love  with  him." 

"Yes,  my  dear  boy,  that's  true.  One  doesn't  mind  admitting 
that  to  you.  But  that's  not  the  reason  he  interests  me.  On  the 
contrary — as  a  rule,  when  my  head's  attracted,  the  rest  of  me 
turns  cold." 

A  servant  came  in  with  wine  and  glasses  on  a  tray. 

"First  of  all  let's  seal  our  bet,  and  afterwards  we'll  have 
another  glass  in  honour  of  the  winner." 

The  servant  poured  out  the  wine  and  they  drank  to  each 
other. 

"Personally,  I  think  your  Vincent  a  bore." 

"Oh,  'my  Vincent'!  ...  As  if  it  hadn't  been  you  who 
brought  him  here!  And  then,  I  advise  you  not  to  go  repeating 
everywhere  that  you  think  him  a  bore.  Your  reason  for  fre- 
quenting him  would  be  too  obvious." 

Robert  turned  a  little  to  put  his  lips  on  Lilian's  bare  foot; 
she  drew  it  away  quickly  and  covered  it  with  her  fan. 

"Must  1  blush?"  said  he. 

"It's  not  worth  while  trying  as  far  as  I  am  concerned.  You 
couldn't  succeed." 

She  emptied  her  glass,  and  then: 

"D'you  know  what,  my  dear  friend?  You  have  all  the  qual- 
ities of  a  man  of  letters — you  are  vain,  hypocritical,  fickle, 
selfish.  .  .  ." 

"You  are  too  flattering!" 

"Yes;  that's  all  very  charming — but  you'll  never  be  a  good 
novelist." 

"Because?" 

"Because  you  don't  know  how  to  listen." 

"It  seems  to  me  I'm  listening  admirably." 

"Pooh!  He  isn't  a  writer  and  he  listens  a  great  deal  better. 
But  when  we  are  together,  /  am  the  one  to  listen." 


i 


43  AT  LADY   GRIFFITH'S 

"He  hardly  knows  how  to  speak." 
"That's  because  you  never  stop  talking  yourself." 
"I  know  everything  he's  going  to  say  beforehand." 
"You  think  so?  Do  you  know  the  story  of  his  affair  with 
that  woman?" 

"Oh!  Love  affairs!  The  dullest  things  in  the  world!" 
"And  then  I  like  it  when  he  talks  about  natural  history." 
"Natural  history  is  even  duller  than  love  affairs.  Does  he  give 
you  lectures  then?" 

"If  1  could  only  repeat  what  he  says.  .  .  .  It's  thrilling,  my 
dear  friend.  He  tells  me  all  sorts  of  things  about  the  deep  seas. 
I've  always  been  particularly  curious  about  creatures  that  live 
in  the  sea.  You  know  that  in  America  they  make  boats  with 
glass  let  into  the  sides,  so  that  you  can  go  to  the  bottom  of  the 
sea  and  look  all  round  you.  They  say  that  the  sights  are  simply 
marvellous — live  coral  and  .  .  .  and  .  .  .  what  do  you  call 
them?  .  .  .  madrepores,  and  sponges,  and  sea-weeds,  and  great 
shoals  of  fish.  Vincent  says  that  there  are  certain  kinds  of  fish 
which  die  according  as  the  water  becomes  more  salt  or  less,  and 
that  there  are  others,  on  the  contrary,  which  can  live  in  any 
degree  of  salt  water;  and  that  they  swim  about  on  the  edge 
of  the  currents,  where  the  water  becomes  less  salt,  so  as  to  prey 
on  the  others  when  their  strength  fails  them.  You  ought  to  get 
him  to  talk  to  you  about  it.  ...  I  assure  you  it's  most  curious. 
When  he  talks  about  things  like  that,  he  becomes  extraordinary. 
You  wouldn't  recognize  him.  .  .  .  But  you  don't  know  how  to 
get  him  to  talk.  .  .  .  It's  like  when  he  tells  me  about  his  affair 
with  Laura  Douviers — yes,  that's  her  name.  ...  Do  you  know 
how  he  got  to  know  her?" 
"Did  he  tell  you?" 

"People  tell  me  everything.  You  know  they  do,  you  shocking 
creature!"  And  she  stroked  his  face  with  the  feathers  of  her 
closed  fan. 

"Did  you  suspect  that  he  had  been  to  see  me  every  single 
day  since  the  evening  you  first  brought  him?" 
"Every  day?  No,  really!  I  didn't  suspect  that." 
"On  the  fourth,  he  couldn't  resist  any  longer;  he  came  out 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  44 

with  the  whole  thing.  But  on  every  day  following,  he  kept  add- 
ing details." 

"And  it  didn't  bore  you?  You're  a  wonder!" 

"I  told  you,  my  dear,  that  1  love  him."  And  she  seized  his 
arm  emphatically. 

"And  he  .  .  .  loves  the  other  woman?" 

Lilian  laughed. 

"He  did  love  her.  Oh,  I  had  to  pretend  at  first  to  be  deeply 
interested  in  her.  I  even  had  to  weep  with  him.  And  all  the  time 
I  was  horribly  jealous.  I'm  not  any  more  now.  Just  listen  how 
it  began.  They  were  at  Pau  together  in  the  same  home — a  san- 
atorium, where  they  had  been  sent  because  they  were  supposed 
to  be  tuberculous.  In  reality,  they  weren't,  either  of  them.  But 
they  thought  they  were  very  ill.  They  were  strangers,  and  the 
first  time  they  saw  each  other  was  on  the  terrace  in  the  garden, 
where  they  were  lying  side  by  side  on  their  deck  chairs;  and 
all  round  them  were  other  patients,  who  spend  the  whole  day 
lying  out  of  doors  in  the  sun  to  get  cured.  As  they  thought  they 
were  doomed  to  die  an  early  death,  they  persuaded  themselves 
that  nothing  they  did  would  be  of  any  consequence.  He  kept 
repeating  all  the  time  that  they  neither  of  them  had  more  than 
a  month  to  live — and  it  was  the  springtime.  She  was  there  all 
alone.  Her  husband  is  a  little  French  professor  in  England.  She 
left  him  to  go  to  Pau.  She  had  been  married  six  months.  He 
had  to  pinch  and  starve  to  send  her  there.  He  used  to  write  to 
her  every  day.  She's  a  young  woman  of  very  good  family — 
very  well  brought  up — very  reserved — very  shy.  But  once  there 
— I  don't  exactly  know  what  he  can  have  said  to  her,  but  on 
the  third  day  she  confessed  that  though  she  lay  with  her  hus- 
band and  belonged  to  him,  she  did  not  know  the  meaning  of 
the  word  pleasure." 

"And  what  did  he  say  then?" 

"He  took  her  hand,  as  it  hung  down  beside  her  chair,  and 
pressed  a  long  kiss  upon  it." 

"And  when  he  told  you  that,  what  did  you  say?" 

"I?  Oh,  frightful!  Only  fancy!  I  went  off  into  a  fou  rire.  I 
couldn't  prevent  myself,  and  once  I  had  begun,  I  couldn't  stop. 


45  AT  LADY   GRIFFITH'S 

.  .  .  It's  not  so  much  what  he  said  that  made  me  laugh — it  was 
the  air  of  interest  and  consternation  which  I  thought  it  neces- 
sary to  take,  in  order  to  encourage  him  to  go  on.  I  was  afraid 
of  seeming  too  much  amused.  And  then,  in  reality,  it  was  all 
very  beautiful  and  touching.  You  can't  imagine  how  moved  he 
was  when  he  told  me  about  it.  He  had  never  spoken  of  it  to 
anyone  before.  Of  course  his  parents  know  nothing  about  it." 

"You  are  the  person  who  ought  to  write  novels." 

"Parhleu,  mon  cher,  if  only  I  knew  what  language  to  write 
them  in!  ,  .  .  But  what  with  Russian,  English  and  French,  I 
should  never  be  able  to  choose. — Well,  the  following  night  he 
went  to  his  new  friend's  room  and  there  taught  her  what  her 
husband  had  never  been  able  to  teach — and  I  expect  he  made 
a  very  good  master.  Only  as  they  were  convinced  that  they  had 
only  a  short  time  to  live,  they  naturally  took  no  precautions, 
and,  naturally,  after  a  little  while,  with  the  help  of  love,  they 
both  began  to  get  much  better.  When  she  realized  she  was 
enceinte,  they  were  in  a  terrible  state.  It  was  last  month.  It 
was  beginning  to  get  hot.  Pau  in  the  summer  is  intolerable. 
They  came  back  to  Paris  together.  Her  husband  thinks  she  is 
with  her  parents,  who  have  a  boarding  school  near  the  Luxem- 
bourg; but  she  didn't  dare  to  go  to  them.  Her  parents,  on  the 
other  hand,  think  she  is  still  in  Pau;  but  it  must  all  come  out 
soon.  Vincent  swore  at  first  not  to  abandon  her;  he  proposed 
going  away  with  her — anywhere — to  America — to  the  Pacific. 
But  they  had  no  money.  It  was  just  at  that  moment  that  he 
met  you  and  began  to  play." 

"He  didn't  tell  me  any  of  all  this." 

"Whatever  happens,  don't  let  him  know  that  I've  told  you." 

She  stopped  and  listened  a  moment. 

"I  thought  I  heard  him.  ...  He  told  me  that,  during  the 
railway  journey  from  Pau  to  Paris,  he  thought  she  was  going 
mad.  She  had  only  just  begun  to  realize  she  was  going  to  have  a 
child.  She  was  sitting  opposite  him  in  the  railway  carriage; 
they  were  alone.  She  hadn't  spoken  to  him  the  whole  morning; 
he  had  had  to  make  all  the  arrangements  for  the  journey  by 
himself — she  was  absolutely  inert — she  seemed  not  to  know 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  46 

what  was  going  on.  He  took  her  hands,  but  she  looked  straight 
in  front  of  her  with  haggard  eyes,  as  if  she  didn't  see  him,  and 
her  lips  kept  moving.  He  bent  towards  her.  She  was  saying:  'A 
lover!  A  lover!  I've  got  a  lover!'  She  kept  on  repeating  it  in 
the  same  tone;  and  still  the  same  word  kept  coming  from  her 
over  and  over  again,  as  if  it  were  the  only  one  she  remembered. 
I  assure  you,  Robert,  that  when  he  told  me  that,  I  didn't  feel 
in  the  least  inclined  to  laugh  any  more.  I've  never  in  my  life 
heard  anything  more  pathetic.  But  all  the  same,  1  felt  that  as 
he  was  speaking  he  was  detaching  himself  more  and  more  from 
the  whole  thing.  It  was  as  though  his  feeling  were  passing  away 
in  the  same  breath  as  his  words;  it  was  as  though  he  were 
grateful  to  my  emotion  for  coming  to  relay  his  own." 

"I  don't  know  how  you  would  say  it  in  Russian  or  English, 
but  I  assure  you  that,  in  French,  you  do  it  exceedingly  well." 

"Thanks.  I'm  aware  of  it. — It  was  after  that,  that  he  began 
to  talk  to  me  about  natural  history;  and  I  tried  to  persuade  him 
that  it  would  be  monstrous  to  sacrifice  his  career  to  his  love." 

"In  other  words,  you  advised  him  to  sacrifice  his  love.  And 
is  it  your  intention  to  take  the  place  of  that  love?" 

Lilian  remained  silent. 

"This  time,  1  think  it  really  is  he,"  went  on  Robert,  rising. 
"Quick!  one  word  before  he  comes  in.  My  father  died  this  eve- 
ning." 

"Ah!"  she  said  simply. 

"You  haven't  a  fancy  to  become  Comtesse  de  Passavant,  have 
you?" 

At  this  Lilian  flung  herself  back  with  a  burst  of  laughter. 

"Oh,  oh,  my  dear  friend !  The  fact  is  I  have  a  vague  recollec- 
tion that  I've  mislaid  a  husband  somewhere  or  other  in  Eng- 
land. What!  I  never  told  you?" 

"Not  that  I  remember." 

"You  might  have  guessed  it;  as  a  rule  a  Lady's  accompanied 
by  a  Lord," 

The  Comte  de  Passavant,  who  had  never  had  much  faith  in 
the  authenticity  of  his  friend's  title,  smiled.  She  went  on:  "Is 
it  to  cloak  your  own  life,  that  you've  taken  it  into  your  head 


47  AT  LADY  GRIFFITH'S 

to  propose  such  a  thing  to  me?  No,  my  dear  friend,  no.  Let's 
stay  as  we  are.  Friends,  eh?"  And  she  held  out  her  hand,  which 
he  kissed. 

"Ah!  Ah!  I  thought  as  much,"  cried  Vincent,  as  he  came  into 
the  room.  "The  traitor!  He  has  dressed!" 

"Yes,  I  had  promised  not  to  change,  so  as  to  keep  him  in 
countenance,"  said  Robert.  "I'm  sorry,  my  dear  fellow,  but  I 
suddenly  remembered  1  was  in  mourning." 

Vincent  held  his  head  high.  An  air  of  triumph  and  of  joy 
breathed  from  his  whole  person.  At  his  arrival,  Lilian  had 
sprung  to  her  feet.  She  looked  him  up  and  down  for  a  moment, 
then  rushed  joyously  at  Robert  and  began  belabouring  his  back 
with  her  fists,  jumping,  dancing  and  exclaiming  as  she  did  so. 
(Lilian  irritates  me  rather  when  she  puts  on  this  affectation  of 
childishness.) 

"He  has  lost  his  bet!  He  has  lost  his  bet!" 

"What  bet?"  asked  Vincent. 

"He  had  bet  that  you  would  lose  your  money  again  to-night. 
Tell  us!  Quickly!  You've  won.  How  much?" 

"I  have  had  the  extraordinary  courage — and  virtue — to  leave 
off  at  fifty  thousand  and  come  away." 

Lilian  gave  a  roar  of  delight. 

"Bravo!  Bravo!  Bravo!"  she  cried.  Then  she  flung  her  arms 
round  Vincent's  neck.  From  head  to  foot,  he  felt  her  glowing, 
lissom  body,  with  its  strange  perfume  of  sandal-wood,  pressed 
against  his  own;  and  Lilian  kissed  him  on  the  forehead,  on  the 
cheeks,  on  the  lips.  Vincent  staggered  and  freed  himself.  He 
took  a  bundle  of  bank-notes  out  of  his  pocket. 

"Here!  take  back  what  you  advanced  me,"  he  said,  holding 
out  five  of  them  to  Robert. 

"No,"  answered  Robert.  "It  is  to  Lady  Lilian  that  you  owe 
them  now."  And  he  handed  her  the  notes,  which  she  flung  on  to 
the  divan.  She  was  panting.  She  went  out  on  the  terrace  to 
breathe.  It  was  that  ambiguous  hour  when  night  is  drawing  to 
an  end,  and  the  devil  casts  up  his  accounts.  Outside  not  a  sound 
was  to  be  heard.  Vincent  had  seated  himself  on  the  divan. 
Lilian  turned  towards  him: 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  48 

"And  now,  what  do  you  mean  to  do?"  she  asked;  and  for  the 
first  time  she  called  him  "thou." 

He  put  his  head  between  his  hands  and  said  with  a  kind  of 
sob: 

"I  don't  know." 

Lilian  went  up  to  him  and  put  her  hand  on  his  forehead;  he 
raised  it  and  his  eyes  were  dry  and  burning. 

"In  the  mean  time,  we'll  drink  each  other's  health,"  said  she, 
and  she  filled  the  three  glasses  with  Tokay.  After  they  had 
drunk: 

"Now  you  must  go.  It's  late  and  I'm  tired  out."  She  accom- 
panied them  into  the  antechamber  and  then,  as  Robert  went 
out  first,  she  slipped  a  little  metal  object  into  Vincent's  hand. 
"Go  out  with  him,"  she  whispered,  "and  come  back  in  a  quarter 
of  an  hour." 

In  the  antechamber  a  footman  was  dozing.  She  shook  him  by 
the  arm. 

"Light  these  gentlemen  downstairs,"  she  said. 

The  staircase  was  dark.  It  would  have  been  a  simple  matter, 
no  doubt,  to  make  use  of  electric  light,  but  she  made  it  a  point 
that  her  visitors  should  always  be  shown  out  by  a  servant. 

The  footman  lighted  the  candles  in  a  big  candelabra,  which 
he  held  high  above  him  and  preceded  Robert  and  Vincent 
downstairs.  Robert's  car  was  waiting  outside  the  door,  which 
the  footman  shut  behind  them. 

"I  think  I  shall  walk  home.  I  need  a  little  exercise  to  steady 
my  nerves,"  said  Vincent,  as  the  other  opened  the  door  of  the 
motor  and  signed  to  him  to  get  in. 

"Don't  you  really  want  me  to  take  you  home?"  And  Robert 
suddenly  seized  Vincent's  left  hand,  which  he  was  holding  shut. 
"Open  your  hand!  Come!  Show  us  what  you've  got  there!" 

Vincent  was  simpleton  enough  to  be  afraid  of  Robert's  jeal- 
ousy. He  blushed  as  he  loosened  his  fingers  and  a  little  key  fell 
on  to  the  pavement.  Robert  picked  it  up  at  once,  looked  at  it 
and  gave  it  back  to  Vincent  with  a  laugh. 

"Ho!  Ho!"  he  said  and  shrugged  his  shoulders.  Then  as  he 


49  AT  LADY   GRIFFITH'S 

was  getting  into  his  car,  he  turned  back  to  Vincent,  who  was 
standing  there  looking  a  little  foolish : 

"It's  Thursday  morning.  Tell  your  brother  that  I  expect  him 
this  afternoon  at  four  o'clock."  And  he  shut  the  door  of  the 
carriage  quickly  without  giving  Vincent  time  to  answer. 

The  car  went  off.  Vincent  walked  a  few  paces  along  the 
quay,  crossed  the  Seine,  and  went  on  till  he  reached  the  part  of 
the  Tuileries  which  lies  outside  the  railings;  going  up  to  the 
little  fountain,  he  soaked  his  handkerchief  in  the  water  and 
pressed  it  on  to  his  forehead  and  his  temples.  Then,  slowly,  he 
walked  back  towards  Lilian's  house.  There  let  us  leave  him, 
while  the  devil  watches  him  with  amusement  as  he  noiselessly 
slips  the  little  key  into  the  keyhole.  .  .  . 

It  is  at  this  same  hour  that  Laura,  his  yesterday's  mistress,  is 
at  last  dropping  off  to  sleep  in  her  gloomy  little  hotel  room, 
after  having  long  wept,  long  bemoaned  herself.  On  the  deck  of 
the  ship  which  is  bringing  him  back  to  France,  Edouard,  in 
the  first  light  of  the  dawn,  is  re-reading  her  letter — the  plaintive 
letter  in  which  she  appeals  for  help.  The  gentle  shores  of  his 
native  land  are  already  in  sight,  though  scarcely  visible  through 
the  morning  mist  to  any  but  a  practised  eye.  Not  a  cloud  is  in 
the  heavens,  where  the  glance  of  God  will  soon  be  smiling.  The 
horizon  is  already  lifting  a  rosy  eyelid.  How  hot  it  is  going  to 
be  in  Paris!  It  is  time  to  return  to  Bernard.  Here  he  is,  just 
awaking  in  Olivier's  bed. 


VI 

BERNARD  AWAKENS 

We  are  all  bastards; 
And  that  most  venerable  man  which  I 
Did  call  my  father,  was  I  know  not  where 
When  I  was  stamped. 

Shakespeare  :   Cymbeline. 

Bernard  has  had  an  absurd  dream.  He  doesn't  remember  his 
dream.  He  doesn't  try  to  remember  his  dream,  but  to  get  out 
of  it.  He  returns  to  the  world  of  reality  to  feel  Olivier's  body 
pressing  heavily  against  him.  Whilst  they  were  asleep  (or  at 
any  rate  while  Bernard  was  asleep)  his  friend  had  come  close 
up  to  him — and,  for  that  matter,  the  bed  was  too  narrow  to 
allow  of  much  distance;  he  had  turned  over;  he  is  sleeping  on 
his  side  now  and  Bernard  feels  Olivier's  warm  breath  tickling 
his  neck.  Bernard  has  nothing  on  but  his  short  day-shirt;  one 
of  Olivier's  arms  is  flung  across  him,  weighing  oppressively  and 
indiscreetly  on  his  flesh.  For  a  moment  Bernard  is  not  sure  that 
Olivier  is  really  asleep.  He  frees  himself  gently.  He  gets  up 
without  waking  Olivier,  dresses  and  then  lies  down  again  on  the 
bed.  It  is  still  too  early  to  be  going.  Four  o'clock.  The  night  is 
only  just  beginning  to  dwindle.  One  more  hour  of  rest,  one 
more  hour  for  gathering  strength  to  start  the  coming  day  val- 
iantly. But  there  is  no  more  sleep  for  him.  Bernard  stares  at  the 
glimmering  window  pane,  at  the  grey  walls  of  the  little  room,  at 
the  iron  bedstead  where  George  is  tossing  in  his  dreams. 

"In  a  moment,"  he  says  to  himself,  "I  shall  be  setting  out  to 
meet  my  fate.  Adventure!  What  a  splendid  word!  The  advent 
of  destiny!  All  the  surprising  unknown  that  awaits  me!  I 
don't  know  if  everyone  is  like  me,  but  as  soon  as  I  am  awake, 
I  like  despising  the  people  who  are  asleep.  Olivier,  my  friend,  I 


51  BERNARD  AWAKENS 

shall  go  off  without  waiting  for  your  good-bye.  Up!  valorous 
Bernard!  The  time  has  come!" 

He  rubs  his  face  with  the  corner  of  a  towel  dipped  in  water, 
brushes  his  hair,  puts  on  his  shoes  and  leaves  the  room  noise- 
lessly. Out  at  last! 

Ah!  the  morning  air  that  has  not  yet  been  breathed,  how  life- 
giving  it  seems  to  body  and  soul!  Bernard  follows  the  railings 
of  the  Luxembourg  Gardens,  goes  down  the  Rue  Bonaparte, 
reaches  the  Quays,  crosses  the  Seine.  He  thinks  of  the  new  rule 
of  life  which  he  has  only  lately  formulated:  "If  /  don't  do  it, 
who  will?  If  I  don't  do  it  at  once,  when  shall  I?"  He  thinks: 
"Great  things  to  do!"  He  feels  that  he  is  going  towards  them. 
"Great  things!"  he  repeats  to  himself,  as  he  walks  along.  If 
only  he  knew  what  they  were!  .  .  .  In  the  mean  time  he  knows 
that  he  is  hungry;  here  he  is  at  the  Halles.  He  has  eight  sous  in 
his  pocket — not  a  sou  more!  He  goes  into  a  public  house  and 
takes  a  roll  and  coffee,  standing  at  the  bar.  Price  six  sous.  He 
has  two  sous  left;  he  gallantly  leaves  one  on  the  counter  and 
holds  out  the  other  to  a  ragamuffm  who  is  grubbing  in  a  dust- 
bin. Charity?  Swagger?  What  does  it  matter?  He  feels  as  happy 
as  a  king.  He  has  nothing  left — and  the  whole  world  is  his! 

"I  expect  anything  and  everything  from  Providence,"  thinks 
he.  "If  only  it  sets  a  handsome  helping  of  roast  beef  before  me 
at  lunch  time,  I  shall  be  willing  to  strike  a  bargain" — for  last 
night  he  had  gone  without  his  dinner.  The  sun  has  risen  long 
ago.  Bernard  is  back  again  on  the  quays  now.  He  feels  all  light- 
ness. When  he  runs  he  feels  as  though  he  were  flying. 
His  thoughts  leap  through  his  brain  with  delicious  ease.  He 
thinks: 

"The  difficulty  in  life  is  to  take  the  same  thing  seriously 
for  long  at  a  time.  For  instance,  my  mother's  love  for  the 
person  I  used  to  call  my  father — I  believed  in  it  for  fifteen 
years.  I  still  believed  in  it  yesterday.  She  wasn't  able  to  take 
her  love  seriously,  either.  I  wonder  whether  I  despise  her  or 
esteem  her  the  more  for  having  made  her  son  a  bastard.  .  .  . 
But  in  reality,  I  don't  wonder  as  much  as  all  that.  The  feelings 
one  has  for  one's  progenitors  are  among  the  things  that  it's 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  52 

better  not  go  into  too  deeply.  As  for  Mr.  Cuckold,  it's  per- 
fectly simple — for  as  far  back  as  I  can  remember,  I've  always 
hated  him;  I  must  admit  now  that  I  didn't  deserve  much 
credit  for  it — and  that's  the  only  thing  I  regret.  To  think  that 
if  I  hadn't  broken  open  that  drawer  I  might  have  gone  on  all 
my  life  believing  that  I  harboured  unnatural  feelings  in  my 
breast  towards  a  father!  What  a  relief  to  know!  ...  All  the 
same  I  didn't  exactly  break  open  the  drawer;  I  never  even 
thought  of  opening  it.  .  .  .  And  there  were  extenuating  circum- 
stances: first  of  all  1  was  horribly  bored  that  day.  And  that  curi- 
osity of  mine — that  'fatal  curiosity'  as  Fenelon  calls  it,  it's  cer- 
tainly the  surest  thing  I've  inherited  from  my  real  father,  for  the 
Profitendieus  haven't  an  ounce  of  it  in  their  composition.  I 
have  never  met  anyone  less  curious  than  the  gentleman  who 
is  my  mother's  husband — unless  perhaps  it's  the  children  he 
has  produced.  I  must  think  about  them  later  on — after  1  have 
dined.  ...  To  lift  up  a  marble  slab  off  the  top  of  a  table  and 
to  see  a  drawer  underneath  is  really  not  the  same  thing  as 
picking  a  lock.  I'm  not  a  burglar.  It  might  happen  to  anyone 
to  lift  the  marble  slab  off  a  table.  Theseus  must  have  been 
about  my  age  when  he  lifted  the  stone.  The  difficulty  in  the 
case  of  a  table  is  the  clock  as  a  rule.  ...  I  shouldn't  have 
dreamt  of  lifting  the  marble  slab  off  the  table  if  I  hadn't 
wanted  to  mend  the  clock.  .  .  .  What  doesn't  happen  to  every- 
one is  to  find  arms  underneath — or  guilty  love-letters.  Pooh! 
The  important  thing  was  that  I  should  learn  the  facts.  It 
isn't  everyone  who  can  indulge  in  the  luxury  of  a  ghost  to 
reveal  them,  like  Hamlet.  Hamlet!  It's  curious  how  one's  point 
of  view  changes  according  as  one  is  the  off-spring  of  crime  or 
legitimacy.  I'll  think  about  that  later  on — after  I  have  dined. 
.  .  .  Was  it  wrong  of  me  to  read  those  letters!  .  .  .  No,  I 
should  be  feeling  remorseful !  And  if  I  hadn't  read  the  letters,  I 
should  have  had  to  go  on  living  in  ignorance  and  falsehood 
and  submission.  Oh,  for  a  draught  of  air!  Oh,  for  the  open 
sea!  'Bernard!  Bernard,  that  green  youth  of  yours  .  .  .'  as 
Bossuet  says.  Seat  your  youth  on  that  bench,  Bernard.  What 
a  beautiful  morning!  There  really  are  days  when  the  sun  seems 


53  BERNARD  AWAKENS 

to  be  kissing  the  earth.  If  I  could  get  rid  of  myself  for  a  little, 
there's  not  a  doubt  but  1  should  write  poetry." 

And  as  he  lay  stretched  on  the  bench,  he  got  rid  of  himself 
so  effectually  that  he  fell  asleep. 


LILIAN  AND   VINCENT 

The  sun,  already  high  in  the  heavens,  caresses  Vincent's  bare 
foot  on  the  wide  bed,  where  he  is  lying  beside  Lilian.  She  sits 
up  and  looks  at  him,  not  knowing  that  he  is  awake,  and  is 
astonished  to  see  a  look  of  anxiety  on  his  face. 

It  is  possible  that  Lady  Griffith  loved  Vincent;  but  what 
she  loved  in  him  was  success.  Vincent  was  tall,  handsome, 
slim,  but  he  did  not  know  how  to  hold  himself,  how  to  sit 
down  or  get  up.  He  had  an  expressive  face,  but  he  did  his 
hair  badly.  Above  all  she  admired  the  boldness  and  robustness 
of  his  intellect;  he  was  certainly  highly  educated,  but  she 
thought  him  uncultivated.  With  the  instinct  of  a  mistress  and 
a  mother,  she  hung  over  this  big  boy  of  hers  and  made  it  her 
task  to  form  him.  He  was  her  creation — her  statue.  She  taught 
him  to  polish  his  nails,  to  part  his  hair  on  one  side  instead 
of  brushing  it  back,  so  that  his  brow,  when  it  was  half  hidden 
by  a  stray  lock,  looked  all  the  whiter  and  loftier.  And  then 
instead  of  the  modest  little  ready-made  bows  he  used  to  wear, 
she  gave  him  really  becoming  neck-ties.  Decidedly  Lady 
Griffith  loved  Vincent;  but  she  could  not  put  up  with  him 
when  he  was  silent  or  "moody,"  as  she  called  it. 

She  gently  passes  a  finger  over  Vincent's  forehead,  as  though 
to  efface  a  wrinkle — those  two  deep  vertical  furrows  which 
start  from  his  eyebrows,  and  give  his  face  a  look  almost  of 
suffering. 

"If  you  are  going  to  bring  me  regrets,  anxieties,  remorse," 
she  murmurs,  as  she  leans  over  him,  "it  would  be  better  never 
to  come  back." 

Vincent  shuts  his  eyes  as  though  to  shut  out  too  bright  a 
light.  The  jubilation  in  Lilian's  face  dazzles  him. 


55  LILIAN   AND   VINCENT 

"You  must  treat  this  as  if  it  were  a  mosque — take  your  shoes 
off  before  you  come  in,  so  as  not  to  bring  in  any  mud  from  the 
outside.  Do  you  suppose  I  don't  know  what  you  are  thinking 
of?"  Then,  as  Vincent  tries  to  put  his  hand  on  her  mouth,  she 
defends  herself  with  the  grace  of  a  naughty  child. 

"No!  Let  me  speak  to  you  seriously.  I  have  reflected  a  great 
deal  about  what  you  said  the  other  day.  People  always  think 
that  women  aren't  capable  of  reflection,  but  you  know,  it  de- 
pends upon  the  woman.  .  .  .  That  thing  you  said  the  other  day 
about  the  products  of  cross  breeding  .  .  .  and  that  it  isn't  by 
crossing  that  one  gets  satisfactory  results  so  much  as  by  se- 
lection. .  .  .  Have  I  remembered  your  lesson,  eh?  Well,  this 
morning  I  think  you  have  bred  a  monster — a  perfectly  ridic- 
ulous creature — you'll  never  rear  it!  A  cross  between  a 
bacchante  and  the  Holy  Ghost!  Haven't  you  now?  .  .  .  You're 
disgusted  with  yourself  for  having  chucked  Laura.  I  can  tell 
it  from  the  lines  on  your  forehead.  If  you  want  to  go  back 
to  her,  say  so  at  once  and  leave  me;  I  shall  have  been  mistaken 
in  you  and  I  shan't  mind  in  the  least.  But  if  you  mean  to  stay 
with  me,  then  get  rid  of  that  funereal  countenance.  You  remind 
me  of  certain  English  people — the  more  emancipated  their 
opinions,  the  more  they  cling  to  their  morality;  so  that  there 
are  no  severer  Puritans  than  their  free-thinkers.  .  .  .  You 
think  I'm  heartless?  You're  wrong.  1  understand  perfectly  that 
you  are  sorry  for  Laura.  But  then,  what  are  you  doing  here?" 

Then,  as  Vincent  turned  his  head  away: 

"Look  here!  You  must  go  to  the  bath-room  now  and  try  and 
wash  your  regrets  off  in  the  shower-bath.  I  shall  ring  for  break- 
fast, eh?  And  when  you  come  back,  I'll  explain  something  that 
you  don't  seem  to  understand." 

He  had  got  up.  She  sprang  after  him. 

"Don't  dress  just  yet.  In  the  cupboard  on  the  right  hand 
side  of  the  bath,  you'll  find  a  collection  of  burnouses  and 
haiks  and  pyjamas.  Take  anything  you  like." 

Vincent  appeared  twenty  minutes  later  dressed  in  a  pistachio 
coloured  silk  jellabah. 

"Oh,    wait    a   minute — wait!    Let   me   arrange   you!"    cried 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  56 

Lilian  in  delight.  She  pulled  out  of  an  oriental  chest  two  wide 
purple  scarves;  wound  the  darker  of  the  two  as  a  sash  round 
Vincent's  waist,  and  the  other  as  a  turban  round  his  head. 
"My  thoughts  are  always  the  same  colour  as  my  clothes," 
she  said.  (She  had  put  on  crimson  and  silver  lame  pyjamas.) 
"I  remember  once,  when  1  was  quite  a  little  girl  at  San  Fran- 
cisco, I  was  put  into  black  because  a  sister  of  my  mother's  had 
died — an  old  aunt  whom  I  had  never  seen.  I  cried  the  whole 
day  long.  I  was  terribly,  terribly  sad;  I  thought  that  I  was 
very  unhappy  and  that  I  was  grieving  deeply  for  my  aunt's 
death — all  because  I  was  in  black.  Nowadays,  if  men  are  more 
serious  than  women,  it's  because  their  clothes  are  darker.  I'll 
wager  that  your  thoughts  are  quite  different  from  what  they 
were  a  little  while  ago.  Sit  down  there  on  the  bed;  and  when 
you've  drunk  a  glass  of  vodka  and  a  cup  of  tea  and  eaten  two 
or  three  sandwiches,  I'll  tell  you  a  story.  Say  when  I'm  to 
begin.  .  .  ." 

She  settled  down  on  the  rug  beside  the  bed,  crouching  between 
Vincent's  legs  like  an  Egyptian  statue,  with  her  chin  resting 
on  her  knees.  When  she  had  eaten  and  drunk,  she  began: 

"I  was  on  the  Bourgogne,  you  know,  on  the  day  of  the  wreck. 
I  was  seventeen,  so  now  you  know  how  old  I  am.  I  was  a  very 
good  swimmer,  and  to  show  you  that  I'm  not  hard-hearted, 
I'll  tell  you  that  if  my  first  thought  was  to  save  myself,  my 
second  was  to  save  someone  else.  I'm  not  quite  sure  even 
whether  it  wasn't  my  first.  Or  rather,  I  don't  think  I  thought 
of  anything;  but  nothing  disgusts  me  so  much  in  such  moments 
as  the  people  who  only  think  of  themselves — oh,  yes — the 
women  who  scream.  There  was  a  first  boatload,  chiefly  of 
women  and  children,  and  some  of  them  yelled  to  such  an  ex- 
tent that  it  was  enough  to  make  anyone  lose  his  head.  The 
boat  was  so  badly  handled  that  instead  of  dropping  down  on 
to  the  sea  straight,  it  dived  nose  foremost  and  everyone  in  it 
was  flung  out  before  it  even  had  time  to  fill  with  water.  The 
whole  scene  took  place  by  the  light  of  torches  and  lanterns 


57  LILIAN   AND   VINCENT 

and  search-lights.  You  can't  imagine  how  ghastly  it  was.  The 
waves  were  very  big  and  everything  that  was  not  in  the  light 
was  lost  in  darkness  on  the  other  side  of  the  hill  of  water. 

"I  have  never  lived  more  intensely;  but  I  was  as  incapable 
of  reflection  as  a  Newfoundland  dog,  I  suppose,  when  he  jumps 
into  the  water.  I  can't  even  understand  now  what  happened; 
I  only  know  that  I  had  noticed  a  little  girl  in  the  boat— a 
darling  thing  of  about  five  or  six;  and  when  I  saw  the  boat 
overturn,  I  immediately  made  up  my  mind  that  it  was  her 
I  would  save.  She  was  with  her  mother,  but  the  poor  woman  was 
a  bad  swimmer;  and  as  usual  in  such  cases,  her  skirts  hampered 
her.  As  for  me,  I  expect  I  undressed  mechanically;  I  was  called 
to  take  my  place  in  the  second  boatload.  I  must  have  got  in; 
and  then  I  no  doubt  jumped  straight  into  the  sea  out  of  the 
boat;  all  I  can  remember  is  swimming  about  for  a  long  time 
with  the  child  clinging  to  my  neck.  It  was  terrified  and  clutched 
me  so  tight  that  I  couldn't  breathe.  Luckily  the  people  in  the 
boat  saw  us  and  either  waited  for  us  or  rowed  towards  us. 
But  that's  not  why  I'm  telling  you  this  story.  The  recollection 
which  remains  most  vividly  with  me  and  which  nothing  will 
ever  efface  from  my  mind  and  my  heart  is  this —  There  were 
about  forty  or  so  of  us  in  the  boat,  all  crowded  together,  for 
a  number  of  swimmers  had  been  picked  up  at  the  last  gasp  like 
me.  The  water  was  almost  on  a  level  with  the  edge  of  the  boat.  I 
was  in  the  stern  and  I  was  holding  the  little  girl  I  had  just  saved 
tightly  pressed  against  me  to  warm  her — and  to  prevent  her 
from  seeing  what  I  couldn't  help  seeing  myself — two  sailors, 
one  armed  with  a  hatchet  and  the  other  with  a  kitchen  chopper. 
And  what  do  you  think  they  were  doing?  .  .  .  They  were 
hacking  off  the  fingers  and  hands  of  the  swimmers  who  were 
trying  to  get  into  our  boat.  One  of  these  two  sailors  (the  other 
was  a  Negro)  turned  to  me,  as  I  sat  there,  my  teeth  chattering 
with  cold  and  fright  and  horror,  and  said,  'If  another  single 
one  gets  in  we  shall  be  bloody  well  done  for.  The  boat's  full.' 
And  he  added  that  it  was  a  thing  that  had  to  be  done  in  all 
shipwrecks,  but  that  naturally  one  didn't  mention  it. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  58 

"I  think  I  fainted  then;  at  any  rate,  I  can't  remember  any- 
thing more,  just  as  one  remains  deaf  for  a  long  time  after  a 
noise  that  has  been  too  tremendous. 

"And  when  I  came  to  myself  on  board  the  X.,  which  picked 
us  up,  I  realized  that  I  was  no  longer  the  same,  that  I  never 
could  again  be  the  same  sentimental  young  girl  I  had  been  be- 
fore; I  realized  that  a  part  of  myself  had  gone  down  with  the 
Bourgogne;  that  henceforth  there  would  be  a  whole  heap  of 
delicate  feelings  whose  fingers  and  hands  I  should  hack  away 
to  prevent  them  from  climbing  into  my  heart  and  wrecking 
it." 

She  looked  at  Vincent  out  of  the  corner  of  her  eye  and,  with 
a  backward  twist  of  her  body,  went  on:  "It's  a  habit  one  must 
get  into." 

Then,  as  her  hair,  which  she  had  pinned  up  loosely,  was 
coming  down  and  falling  over  her  shoulders,  she  rose,  went 
up  to  a  mirror  and  began  to  re-arrange  it,  talking  as  she 
did  so: 

"When  I  left  America  a  little  later,  I  felt  as  if  I  were  the 
golden  fleece  starting  off  in  search  of  a  conqueror.  I  may  some- 
times have  been  foolish  ...  I  may  sometimes  have  made  mis- 
takes— perhaps  I  am  making  one  now  in  talking  to  you  like 
this — but  you,  on  your  side,  don't  imagine  that  because  I  have 
given  myself  to  you,  you  have  won  me.  Make  certain  of  this — 
I  abominate  mediocrity  and  I  can  love  no  one  who  isn't  a 
conqueror.  If  you  want  me,  it  must  be  to  help  you  to  victory; 
if  it's  only  to  be  pitied  and  consoled  and  made  much  of  .  .  ,  no, 
my  dear  boy — I'd  better  say  so  at  once — I'm  not  the  person 
you  need — it's  Laura." 

She  said  all  this  without  turning  round  and  while  she  was 
continuing  to  arrange  her  rebellious  locks,  but  Vincent  caught 
her  eye  in  the  glass. 

"May  I  give  you  my  answer  this  evening?"  he  said,  getting 
up  and  taking  off  his  oriental  garments  to  get  into  his  day 
clothes.  "1  must  go  home  quickly  now  so  as  to  catch  my  brother 
Olivier  before  he  goes  out.  I've  got  something  to  say  to  him." 

He  said  it  by  way  of  apology,  to  give  colour  to  his  de- 


59  LILIAN   AND  VINCENT 

parture;  but  when  he  went  up  to  Lilian,  she  turned  round  to 
him  smiling,  and  so  lovely  that  he  hesitated. 

"Unless  I  leave  a  line  for  him  to  get  at  lunch  time,"  he 
added. 

"Do  you  see  a  great  deal  of  him?" 

"Hardly  anything.  No,  it's  an  invitation  for  this  afternoon, 
which  I've  got  to  pass  on  to  him."  •*. 

"From  Robert?  .  .  .  Oh!  I  see!  ^  .  .  ."  she  said,  smiling 
oddly.  "That's  a  person,  too,  I  must  talk  to  you  about.  ...  All 
right!  Go  at  once.  But  come  back  at  six  o'clock,  because  at 
seven  his  car  is  coming  to  take  us  out  to  dinner  in  the  Bois." 

Vincent  walks  home,  meditating  as  he  goes;  he  realizes  that 
from  the  satisfaction  of  desire  there  may  arise,  accompanying 
joy  and  as  it  were  sheltering  behind  it,  something  not  unlike 
despair.

EDOUARD   AND   LAURA 

II  faut  choisir  d'aimer  hi  femmes  ou  de  les 
connaitre;  il  n'y  a  pas  de  milieu. 

Chamfort. 

Edouard,  as  he  sits  in  the  Paris  express,  is  reading  Passavant's 
new  bcx)k,  The  Horizontal  Bar,  which  he  has  just  bought  at  the 
Dieppe  railway  station.  No  doubt  he  will  find  the  book  waiting 
for  him  when  he  gets  to  Paris,  but  Edouard  is  impatient. 
People  are  talking  of  it  everywhere.  Not  one  of  his  own  books 
has  ever  had  the  honour  of  figuring  on  station  book-stalls. 
He  has  been  told,  it  is  true,  that  it  would  be  an  easy  matter 
to  arrange,  but  he  doesn't  care  to.  He  repeats  to  himself  that 
he  hasn't  the  slightest  desire  to  see  his  books  in  railway  stations 
— but  it  is  the  sight  of  Passavant's  book  that  makes  him  feel 
the  need  of  repeating  it.  Everything  that  Passavant  does,  and 
everything  that  other  people  do  round  about  him,  rubs  Edouard 
up  the  wrong  way:  the  newspaper  articles,  for  instance,  in 
which  his  book  is  praised  up  to  the  skies.  It's  as  if  it  were  a 
wager;  in  every  one  of  the  three  papers  that  he  buys  on  land- 
ing, there  is  a  eulogy  of  The  Horiiontal  Bar.  In  the  fourth 
there  is  a  letter  from  Passavant,  complaining  of  an  article 
which  had  recently  appeared  in  the  same  paper  and  which  had 
been  a  trifle  less  flattering  than  the  others.  Passavant  writes 
defending  and  explaining  his  book.  This  letter  irritates  Edouard 
even  more  than  the  articles.  Passavant  pretends  to  enlighten 
public  opinion — in  reality  he  cleverly  directs  it.  None  of 
Edouard's  books  has  ever  given  rise  to  such  a  crop  of  articles; 
but,  for  that  matter,  Edouard  has  never  made  the  slightest 
attempt  to  attract  the  favour  of  the  critics.  If  they  turn  him 
the  cold  shoulder,  it  is  a  matter  of  indifference  to  him.  But 


61  EDOUARD  AND  LAURA 

as  he  reads  the  articles  on  his  rival's  book,  he  feels  the  need 
of  assuring  himself  again  that  it  is  a  matter  of  indifference. 

Not  that  he  detests  Passavant.  He  has  met  him  occasionally 
and  has  thought  him  charming.  Passavant,  moreover,  has 
always  been  particularly  amiable  to  him.  But  he  dislikes  Pas- 
savant's  books.  He  thinks  Passavant  not  so  much  an  artist  as 
a  juggler.  Enough  of  Passavant! 

Edouard  takes  Laura's  letter  out  of  his  coat  pocket — the 
letter  he  was  reading  on  the  boat;  he  reads  it  again: 

"Dear  friend. 

The  last  time  I  saw  you — (do  you  remember? — it  was  in 
St.  James's  Park,  on  the  2nd  of  April,  the  day  before  I  left  for 
the  South?)  you  made  me  promise  to  write  to  you  if  ever  I 
was  in  any  difficulty.  I  am  keeping  my  promise.  To  whom  can 
I  appeal  but  you?  I  cannot  ask  for  help  from  those  to  whomi 
I  should  most  like  to  turn;  it  is  just  from  them  that  1  must 
hide  my  trouble.  Dear  friend,  1  am  in  very  great  trouble.  Some 
day  perhaps,  1  will  tell  you  the  story  of  my  life  after  I  parted 
from  Felix.  He  took  me  out  to  Pau  and  then  he  had  to  return 
to  Cambridge  for  his  lectures.  What  came  over  me,  when  I 
was  left  out  there  all  by  myself — the  spring — my  convalescence 
— my  solitude?  .  .  .  Dare  I  confess  to  you  what  it  is  impos- 
sible to  tell  Felix?  The  time  has  come  when  I  ought  to  go 
back  to  him — but  oh!  1  am  no  longer  worthy  to.  The  letters 
which  1  have  been  writing  to  him  for  some  time  past  have 
been  lying  letters,  and  the  ones  he  writes  to  me  speak  of  nothing 
but  his  joy  at  hearing  that  1  am  better.  1  wish  to  heaven  I  had 
remained  ill!  I  wish  to  heaven  I  had  died  out  there!  .  .  .  My 
friend,  the  fact  must  be  faced:  1  am  expecting  a  child  and  it 
is  not  his.  I  left  Felix  more  than  three  months  ago;  there's  no 
possibility  of  blinding  him  at  any  rate.  I  dare  not  go  back  to 
him.  I  cannot.  I  will  not.  He  is  too  good.  He  would  forgive 
me,  no  doubt,  and  I  don't  deserve — 1  don't  want  his  forgiveness, 
I  daren't  go  back  to  my  parents  either.  They  think  1  am  still 
at  Pau.  My  father — if  he  knew,  if  he  understood — is  capable 
of  cursing  me.  He  would  turn  me  away.  And  how  could  1  face 
his  virtue,  his  horror  of  evil,  of  lying,  of  everything  that  is 
impure?  I  am  afraid  too  of  grieving  my  mother  and  my  sister. 
As  for  .  .  .  but  I  will  not  accuse  him;  when  he  was  in  a  position 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  62 

to  help  me,  he  promised  to  do  so.  Unfortunately,  however,  in 
order  to  be  better  able  to  help  me,  he  took  to  gambling.  He 
has  lost  the  money  which  should  have  served  to  keep  me  until 
after  my  confinement.  He  has  lost  it  all.  I  had  thought  at  first 
of  going  away  with  him  somewhere — anywhere;  of  living  with 
him  at  any  rate  for  a  short  time,  for  1  didn't  mean  to  hamper 
him — to  be  a  burden  to  him;  I  should  have  ended  by  finding 
some  way  of  earning  my  living,  but  I  can't  just  yet.  1  can  see 
that  he  is  unhappy  at  having  to  abandon  me  and  that  it  is  the 
only  thing  that  he  can  do.  I  don't  blame  him — but  all  the  same 
he  is  abandoning  me.  I  am  here  in  Paris  without  any  money.  I 
am  living  on  credit  in  a  little  hotel,  but  it  can't  go  on  much 
longer.  I  don't  know  what  is  to  become  of  me.  To  think  that  ways 
so  sweet  should  lead  only  to  such  depths  as  these!  I  am  writing 
to  the  address  in  London  which  you  gave  me.  But  when  will  this 
letter  reach  you?  And  I  who  longed  so  to  have  a  child!  I  do 
nothing  but  cry  all  day  long.  Advise  me.  You  are  the  only  hope 
I  have  left.  Help  me  if  you  can,  and  if  you  can't  ...  Oh!  in 
other  days  I  should  have  had  more  courage,  but  now  it  is  not 
I  alone  who  will  die.  If  you  don't  come — if  you  write  that  you 
can  do  nothing  for  me,  I  shall  have  no  word  or  thought  of  re- 
proach for  you.  In  bidding  you  good-bye,  I  shall  try  and  not 
regret  life  too  much,  but  I  think  that  you  never  quite  understood 
that  the  friendship  you  gave  me  is  still  the  best  thing  in  rny 
life — never  quite  understood  that  what  I  called  my  friendship 
for  you  went  by  another  name  in  my  heart. 

Laura  Douviers 

P.  S.  Before  putting  this  letter  in  the  post  I  shall  make  another 
attempt.  This  evening  I  shall  go  and  see  him  one  last  time  more. 
If  you  get  this  therefore  it  will  mean  that  really  .  .  .  Good- 
bye, good-bye!  I  don't  know  what  I  am  writing. 

Edouard  had  received  this  letter  on  the  morning  of  the  day 
he  had  left  England.  That  is  to  say  he  had  decided  to  leave 
as  soon  as  he  received  it.  In  any  case  he  had  not  intended  to 
stay  much  longer.  I  don't  mean  to  insinuate  that  he  would 
have  been  incapable  of  returning  to  Paris  specially  to  help 
Laura;  I  merely  say  that  he  is  glad  to  return.  He  has  been 
kept  terribly  short  of  pleasure  lately  in  England;  and  the  first 
thing  he  means  to  do  when  he  gets  to  Paris  is  to  go  to  a  house 


63  EDOUARD  AND  LAURA 

of  ill-fame;  and  as  he  doesn't  wish  to  take  his  private  papers 
with  him,  he  reaches  his  portmanteau  down  from  the  rack 
and  opens  it,  so  as  to  slip  in  Laura's  letter. 

The  place  for  this  letter  is  not  among  coats  and  shirts;  he 
pulls  out  from  beneath  the  clothes  a  cloth-bound  MS.  book, 
half  filled  with  his  writing;  turns  to  the  very  beginning  of 
the  book,  looks  up  certain  pages  which  were  written  last  year 
and  re-reads  them;  it  is  between  these  that  Laura's  letter  will 
find  its  proper  place. 

EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL 

Oct.  18th.  — Laura  does  not  seem  to  suspect  her  power;  but  I, 
who  can  unravel  the  secrets  of  my  own  heart,  know  well 
enough  that  up  till  now  I  have  never  written  a  line  that  has 
not  been  indirectly  inspired  by  her.  I  feel  her  still  a  child 
beside  me,  and  all  the  skill  of  my  discourse  is  due  only  to 
my  constant  desire  to  instruct,  to  convince,  to  captivate  her. 
I  see  nothing — 1  hear  nothing  without  asking  myself  what 
she  would  think  of  it.  I  forsake  my  own  emotion  to  feel  only 
hers.  And  I  think  that  if  she  were  not  there  to  give  definition 
to  my  personality,  it  would  vanish  in  the  excessive  vagueness 
of  its  contours.  It  is  only  round  her  that  I  concentrate  and 
define  myself.  By  what  illusion  have  I  hitherto  believed  that 
I  was  fashioning  her  to  my  likeness,  when,  on  the  contrary,  I 
was  bending  myself  to  hers?  And  I  never  noticed  it!  Or 
rather — the  influence  of  love,  by  a  curious  action  of  give  and 
take,  made  us  both  reciprocally  alter  our  natures.  Involuntarily 
— unconsciously — each  one  of  a  pair  of  lovers  fashions  himself 
to  meet  the  other's  requirements — endeavours  by  a  continual 
effort  to  resemble  that  idol  of  himself  which  he  beholds  in  the 
other's  heart.  .  .  .  Whoever  really  loves  abandons  all  sincerity. 

This  was  the  way  in  which  she  deluded  me.  Her  thought 
everywhere  companioned  mine.  I  admired  her  taste,  her 
curiosity,  her  culture,  and  did  not  realize  that  it  was  her  love 
for  me  which  made  her  take  so  passionate  an  interest  in  every- 
thing that  I   cared  for.   For  she  never  discovered  anything 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  64 

herself.  Each  one  of  her  admirations — I  see  it  now — was  merely 
a  couch  on  which  she  could  lay  her  thought  alongside  of  mine; 
there  was  nothing  in  all  this  that  responded  to  any  profound 
need  of  her  nature.  "It  was  only  for  you  that  I  adorned  and 
decked  myself,"  she  will  say.  Yes!  But  I  could  have  wished  that 
it  had  been  only  for  her  and  that  she  had  yielded  in  doing  so 
to  an  intimate  and  personal  necessity.  But  of  all  these  things 
that  she  has  added  to  herself  for  my  sake,  nothing  will  remain 
— not  even  a  regret — not  even  a  sense  of  something  missing.  A 
day  comes  when  the  true  self,  which  time  has  slowly  stripped 
of  all  its  borrowed  raiment,  reappears,  and  then,  if  it  was  of 
these  ornaments  that  the  other  was  enamoured,  he  finds  that 
he  is  pressing  to  his  heart  nothing  but  an  empty  dress — nothing 
but  a  memory — nothing  but  grief  and  despair. 

Ah!  with  what  virtues,  with  what  perfections  I  had  adorned 
her! 

How  vexing  this  question  of  sincerity  is!  Sincerity!  When 
I  say  the  word  I  think  only  of  her.  If  it  is  myself  that  I  con- 
sider, I  cease  to  understand  its  meaning.  I  am  never  anything 
but  what  I  think  myself — and  this  varies  so  incessantly,  that 
often,  if  I  were  not  there  to  make  them  acquainted,  my  morn- 
ing's self  would  not  recognize  my  evening's.  Nothing  could  be 
more  different  from  me  than  myself.  It  is  only  sometimes  when 
I  am  alone  that  the  substratum  emerges  and  that  I  attain  a 
certain  fundamental  continuity;  but  at  such  times  I  feel  that 
my  life  is  slowing  down,  stopping,  and  that  I  am  on  the  very 
verge  of  ceasing  to  exist.  My  heart  beats  only  out  of  sympathy; 
I  live  only  through  others — by  procuration,  so  to  speak,  and  by 
espousals;  and  I  never  feel  myself  living  so  intensely  as  when 
I  escape  from  myself  to  become  no  matter  who. 

This  anti-egoistical  force  of  decentralization  is  so  great  in 
me,  that  it  disintegrates  my  sense  of  property — and,  as  a  con- 
sequence, of  responsibility.  Such  a  being  is  not  of  the  kind  that 
one  can  marry.  How  can  I  make  Laura  understand  this? 

Oct.  26th. — ^The  only  existence  that  anything  (including  my- 


65  EDOUARD  AND  LAURA 

self)  has  for  me,  is  poetical — I  restore  this  word  its  full  signifi- 
cation. It  seems  to  me  sometimes  that  I  do  not  really  exist, 
but  that  I  merely  imagine  I  exist.  The  thing  that  I  have  the 
greatest  difficulty  in  believing  in,  is  my  own  reality.  I  am  con- 
stantly getting  outside  myself,  and  as  I  watch  myself  act  I  can- 
not understand  how  a  person  who  acts  is  the  same  as  the  person 
who  is  watching  him  act,  and  who  wonders  in  astonishment 
and  doubt  how  he  can  be  actor  and  watcher  at  the  same 
moment. 

Psychological  analysis  lost  all  interest  for  me  from  the 
moment  that  I  became  aware  that  men  feel  what  they  imagine 
they  feel.  From  that  to  thinking  that  they  imagine  they  feel 
what  they  feel  was  a  very  short  step  .  .  .  !  I  see  it  clearly  in 
the  case  of  my  love  for  Laura:  between  loving  her  and  im- 
agining I  love  her — between  imagining  I  love  her  less  and  loving 
her  less — what  God  could  tell  the  difference?  In  the  domain  of 
feeling,  what  is  real  is  indistinguishable  from  what  is  imaginary. 
And  if  it  is  sufficient  to  imagine  one  loves,  in  order  to  love,  so 
it  is  sufficient  to  say  to  oneself  that  when  one  loves  one  imagines 
one  loves,  in  order  to  love  a  little  less  and  even  in  order  to  de- 
tach oneself  a  little  from  one's  love,  or  at  any  rate  to  de- 
tach some  of  the  crystals  from  one's  love.  But  if  one  is  able 
to  say  such  a  thing  to  oneself,  must  one  not  already  love  a 
little  less? 

It  is  by  such  reasoning  as  this,  that  X.  in  my  book  tries  to 
detach  himself  from  Z. — and,  still  more,  tries  to  detach  her 
from  himself. 

Oct.  28th. — People  are  always  talking  of  the  sudden  crystal- 
lization of  love.  Its  slow  decrystalUiation,  which  I  never  hear 
talked  of,  is  a  psychological  phenomenon  which  interests  me 
far  more.  I  consider  that  it  can  be  observed,  after  a  longer  or 
shorter  period,  in  all  love  marriages.  There  will  be  no  reason 
to  fear  this,  indeed,  in  Laura's  case  (and  so  much  the  better) 
if  she  marries  Felix  Douviers,  as  reason,  and  her  family,  and 
I  myself  advise  her  to  do.  Douviers  is  a  thoroughly  estimable 
professor,  with  many  excellent  points,  and  very  capable  in  his

own  line  (I  hear  that  he  is  greatly  appreciated  by  his  pupils). 
In  process  of  time  and  in  the  wear  of  daily  life,  Laura  is  sure 
to  discover  in  him  all  the  more  virtues  for  having  had  fewer 
illusions  to  begin  with;  when  she  praises  him,  indeed,  she 
seems  to  me  really  not  to  give  him  his  due.  Douviers  is  worth 
more  than  she  thinks. 

What  an  admirable  subject  for  a  novel — the  progressive  and 
reciprocal  decrystallization  of  a  husband  and  wife  after  fifteen 
or  twenty  years  of  married  life.  So  long  as  he  loves  and  desires 
to  be  loved,  the  lover  cannot  show  himself  as  he  really  is,  and 
moreover  he  does  not  see  the  beloved — but  instead,  an  idol 
whom  he  decks  out,  a  divinity  whom  he  creates. 

So  I  have  warned  Laura  to  be  on  her  guard  against  both 
herself  and  me.  I  have  tried  to  persuade  her  that  our  love 
could  not  bring  either  of  us  any  lasting  happiness.  I  hope  I 
have  more  or  less  convinced  her. 

Edouard  shrugs  his  shoulders,  slips  the  letter  in  between  the 
leaves  of  his  journal,  shuts  it  up  and  replaces  it  in  his  suit- 
case. He  then  takes  a  hundred-franc  note  out  of  his  pocket-book 
and  puts  that  too  in  his  suit-case.  This  sum  will  be  more  than 
sufficient  to  last  him  till  he  can  fetch  his  suit-case  from  the 
cloak-room,  where  he  means  to  deposit  it  on  his  arrival.  The 
tiresome  thing  is  that  it  has  got  no  key — or  at  any  rate  he  has 
not  got  its  key.  He  always  loses  the  keys  of  his  suit-cases. 
Pooh!  The  cloak-room  attendants  are  too  busy  during  the  day- 
time and  never  alone.  He  will  fetch  it  out  at  about  four  o'clock 
and  then  go  to  comfort  and  help  Laura;  he  will  try  and  per- 
suade her  to  come  out  to  dinner  with  him. 

Edouard  dozes;  insensibly  his  thoughts  take  another  direc- 
tion. He  wonders  whether  he  would  have  guessed  merely  by 
reading  Laura's  letter,  that  her  hair  was  black.  He  says  to 
himself  that  novelists,  by  a  too  exact  description  of  their 
characters,  hinder  the  reader's  imagination  rather  than  help  it, 
and  that  they  ought  to  allow  each  individual  to  picture  their 
personages  to  himself  according  to  his  own  fancy.  He  thinks 


67  EDOUARD  AND  LAURA 

of  the  novel  which  he  is  planning  and  which  is  to  be  like  nothing 
else  he  has  ever  written.  He  is  not  sure  that  The  Counterfeiters 
is  a  good  title.  He  was  wrong  to  have  announced  it  before- 
hand. An  absurd  custom  this  of  publishing  the  titles  of  books 
in  advance,  in  order  to  whet  the  reader's  appetite!  It  whets 
nobody's  appetite  and  it  ties  one.  He  is  not  sure  either  that 
the  subject  is  a  very  good  one.  He  is  continually  thinking  of 
it  and  has  been  thinking  of  it  for  a  long  time  past;  but  he  has 
not  yet  written  a  line  of  it.  On  the  other  hand,  he  puts  down  his 
notes  and  reflections  in  a  little  note-book.  He  takes  this  note- 
book out  of  his  suit-case  and  a  fountain  pen  out  of  his  pocket. 
He  writes: 

I  should  like  to  strip  the  novel  of  every  element  that  does 
not  specifically  belong  to  the  novel.  Just  as  photography  in  the 
past  freed  painting  from  its  concern  for  a  certain  sort  of  accu- 
racy, so  the  phonograph  will  eventually  no  doubt  rid  the  novel 
of  the  kind  of  dialogue  which  is  drawn  from  the  life  and  which 
realists  take  so  much  pride  in.  Outward  events,  accidents,  trau- 
matisms, belong  to  the  cinema.  The  novel  should  leave  them 
to  it.  Even  the  description  of  the  characters  does  not  seem  to 
me  properly  to  belong  to  the  genre.  No;  this  does  not  seem  to 
me  the  business  of  the  pure  novel  (and  in  art,  as  in  everything 
else,  purity  is  the  only  thing  I  care  about).  No  more  than  it  is 
the  business  of  the  drama.  And  don't  let  it  be  argued  that  the 
dramatist  does  not  describe  his  characters  because  the  spectator 
is  intended  to  see  them  transposed  alive  on  the  stage;  for  how 
often  on  the  stage  an  actor  irritates  and  baffles  us  because  he  is 
so  unlike  the  person  our  own  imagination  had  figured  better 
without  him.  The  novelist  does  not  as  a  rule  rely  sufficiently 
on  the  reader's  imagination. 

What  is  the  station  that  has  just  flashed  past?  Asnieres. 
He  puts  the  note-book  back  in  his  suit-case.  But,  decidedly, 
the  thought  of  Passavant  vexes  him.  He  takes  the  note-book 
out  again  and  adds: 

The  work  of  art,  as  far  as  Passavant  is  concerned,  is  not  so 
much  an  end  as  a  means.  The  artistic  convictions  which  he 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  68 

displays  are  asserted  with  so  much  vehemence  merely  because 
they  lack  depth;  no  secret  exigence  of  his  temperament  necessi- 
tates them;  they  are  evoked  by  the  passing  hour;  their  Tnot 
d'ordre  is  opportunism. 

The  Horizontal  Bar!  The  things  that  soonest  appear  out  of 
date  are  those  that  at  first  strike  us  as  most  modern.  Every  con- 
cession, every  affectation  is  the  promise  of  a  wrinkle.  But  it  is 
by  these  means  that  Passavant  pleases  the  young.  He  snaps 
his  fingers  at  the  future.  It  is  the  generation  of  to-day  that  he  is 
speaking  to — which  is  certainly  better  than  speaking  to  that  of 
yesterday.  But  as  what  he  writes  is  addressed  only  to  that 
younger  generation,  it  is  in  danger  of  disappearing  with  it.  He 
is  perfectly  aware  of  this  and  does  not  build  his  hopes  on  sur- 
viving. This  is  the  reason  that  he  defends  himself  so  fiercely, 
and  that,  not  only  when  he  is  attacked,  but  at  the  slightest  re- 
strictions of  the  critics.  If  he  felt  that  his  work  was  lasting  he 
would  leave  it  to  defend  itself  and  would  not  so  continually  seek 
to  justify  it.  More  than  that,  misunderstanding,  injustice,  would 
rejoice  him.  So  much  the  more  food  for  to-morrow's  critics  to 
use  their  teeth  upon! 

He  looks  at  his  watch:  11.35.  He  ought  to  have  arrived  by 
now.  Curious  to  know  if  by  any  impossible  chance  Olivier 
will  be  at  the  station  to  meet  him?  He  hasn't  the  slightest 
expectation  of  'it.  How  can  he  even  suppose  that  his  post-card 
has  come  to  Olivier's  notice — that  post-card  on  which  he  in- 
formed Olivier's  parents  of  his  return,  and  incidentally,  care- 
lessly, absent-mindedly  to  all  appearance,  mentioned  the  day 
and  hour  of  his  arrival  ...  as  one  takes  a  pleasure  in  stalk- 
ing— in  setting  a  trap  for  fate  itself. 

The  train  is  stopping.  Quick!  A  porter!  No!  His  suit-case  is 
not  very  heavy,  nor  the  cloak-room  very  far.  ,  .  .  Even  sup- 
posing he  were  there,  would  they  recognize  each  other  in  all 
this  crowd?  They  have  seen  so  little  of  each  other.  If  only  he 
hasn't  grown  out  of  recognition!  ...  Ah!  Great  Heavens! 
Can  that  be  he?

EDOUARD  AND  OLIVIER 

We  should  have  nothing  to  deplore  of  all  that  happened 
later  if  only  Edouard's  and  Olivier's  joy  at  meeting  had  been 
more  demonstrative;  but  they  both  had  a  singular  incapacity 
for  gauging  their  credit  in  other  people's  hearts  and  minds; 
this  now  paralysed  them;  so  that  each,  believing  his  emotion 
to  be  unshared,  absorbed  in  his  own  joy,  and  half  ashamed 
at  finding  it  so  great,  was  completely  preoccupied  by  trying 
to  hide  its  intensity  from  the  other. 

It  was  for  this  reason  that  Olivier,  far  from  helping  Edouard's 
joy  by  telling  him  with  what  eagerness  he  had  come  to  meet 
him,  thought  fit  to  speak  of  some  job  or  other  which  he  had 
had  to  do  in  the  neighbourhood  that  very  morning,  as  if  to 
excuse  himself  for  having  come.  His  conscience,  scrupulous  to 
excess,  cunningly  set  about  persuading  him  that  he  was  per- 
haps in  Edouard's  way.  The  lie  was  hardly  out  of  his  mouth 
when  he  blushed.  Edouard  surprised  the  blush,  and  as  he  had 
at  first  seized  Olivier's  arm  and  passionately  pressed  it,  he 
thought  (scrupulous  he,  too)  that  it  was  this  that  had  made 
him  blush. 

He  had  begun  by  saying: 

"I  tried  to  force  myself  to  believe  that  you  wouldn't  come, 
but  in  reality  I  was  certain  that  you  would." 

Then  it  came  over  him  that  Olivier  thought  these  words 
presumptuous.  When  he  heard  him  answer  in  an  off-hand  way: 
"I  had  a  job  to  do  in  this  very  neighbourhood,"  he  dropped 
Olivier's  arm  and  his  spirits  fell  from  their  heights.  He  would 
have  liked  to  ask  Olivier  whether  he  had  understood  that  the 
post-card  which  he  had  addressed  to  his  parents,  had  been 
really  intended  for  him;  as  he  was  on  the  point  of  putting 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  70 

the  question,  his  heart  failed  him.  Olivier,  who  was  afraid  of 
boring  Edouard  or  of  being  misunderstood  if  he  spoke  of  him- 
self, kept  silent.  He  looked  at  Edouard  and  was  astonished  at 
the  trembling  of  his  lip;  then  he  dropped  his  eyes  at  once. 
Edouard  was  both  longing  for  the  look  and  afraid  that  Olivier 
would  think  him  too  old.  He  kept  rolling  a  bit  of  paper  nerv- 
ously between  his  fingers.  It  was  the  ticket  he  had  just  been 
given  at  the  cloak-room,  but  he  did  not  think  of  that. 

"If  it  was  his  cloak-room  ticket,"  thought  Olivier,  as  he 
watched  him  crumple  it  up  and  throw  it  absent-mindedly  away, 
"he  wouldn't  throw  it  away  like  that."  And  he  glanced  round 
for  a  second  to  see  the  wind  carry  it  off  along  the  pavement  far 
behind  them.  If  he  had  looked  longer  he  might  have  seen  a 
young  man  pick  it  up.  It  was  Bernard,  who  had  been  following 
them  ever  since  they  had  left  the  station.  ...  In  the  mean 
while  Olivier  was  in  despair  at  finding  nothing  to  say  to 
Edouard,  and  the  silence  between  them  became  intolerable. 

"When  we  get  opposite  Condorcet,"  he  kept  repeating  to  him- 
self, "I  shall  say,  'I  must  go  home  now;  good-bye.' " 

Then,  when  they  got  opposite  the  Lycee,  he  gave  himself 
till  as  far  as  the  corner  of  the  Rue  de  Provence.  But  Edouard, 
on  whom  the  silence  was  weighing  quite  as  heavily,  could  not 
endure  that  they  should  part  in  this  way.  He  drew  his  com- 
panion into  a  cafe.  Perhaps  the  port  wine  which  he  ordered 
would  help  them  to  get  the  better  of  their  embarrassment. 

They  drank  to  each  other. 

"Good  luck  to  you!"  said  Edouard,  raising  his  glass.  "When 
is  the  examination?" 

"In  ten  days." 

"Do  you  feel  ready?" 

Olivier  shrugged  his  shoulders.  "One  never  knows.  If  one 
doesn't  happen  to  be  in  good  form  on  the  day  ,  .  ." 

He  didn't  dare  answer  "yes,"  for  fear  of  seeming  conceited. 
He  was  embarrassed,  too,  because  he  wanted  and  yet  was  afraid 
to  say  "thou"  to  Edouard.  He  contented  himself  by  giving  his 
sentences  an  impersonal  turn,  so  as  to  avoid  at  any  rate  saying 
"you";  and  by  so  doing  he  deprived  Edouard  of  the  oppor- 


71  EDOUARD  AND  OLIVIER 

tunity  of  begging  him  to  say  "thou" — which  Edouard  longed 
for  him  to  do  and  which  he  remembered  well  enough  he  had 
done  a  few  days  before  his  leaving  for  England. 

"Have  you  been  working?" 

"Pretty  well,  but  not  as  well  as  I  might  have." 

"People  who  work  well  always  think  they  might  work  better," 
said  Edouard  rather  pompously. 

He  said  it  in  spite  of  himself  and  then  thought  his  sentence 
ridiculous. 

"Do  you  still  write  poetry?" 

"Sometimes  ...  I  badly  want  a  little  advice."  He  raised  his 
eyes  to  Edouard.  "Your  advice,"  he  wanted  to  say — "thy 
advice."  And  his  look,  in  default  of  his  voice,  said  it  so  plainly 
that  Edouard  thought  he  was  saying  it  out  of  deference — out 
of  amiability.  But  why  should  he  have  answered — and  so 
brusquely  too  .  .  .  ? 

"Oh,  one  must  go  to  oneself  for  advice,  or  to  companions  of 
one's  own  age.  One's  elders  are  no  use." 

Olivier  thought:  "I  didn't  ask  him.  Why  is  he  protesting?" 

Each  of  them  was  vexed  with  himself  for  not  being  able  to 
utter  a  word  that  didn't  sound  curt  and  stiff;  and  each  of  them, 
feeling  the  other's  embarrassment  and  irritation,  thought  him- 
self the  cause  and  object  of  them.  Such  interviews  lead  to  no 
good  unless  something  comes  to  the  rescue.  Nothing  came. 

Olivier  had  begun  the  morning  badly.  When,  on  waking 
up,  he  had  found  that  Bernard  was  no  longer  beside  him,  that 
he  had  left  him  without  saying  good-bye,  his  heart  had  been 
filled  with  unhappiness;  though  he  had  forgotten  it  for  an  in- 
stant in  the  joy  of  seeing  Edouard,  it  now  surged  up  in  him 
anew  like  a  black  wave  and  submerged  every  other  thought  in 
his  mind.  He  would  have  liked  to  talk  about  Bernard,  to  tell 
Edouard  everything  and  anything,  to  make  him  interested  in 
his  friend. 

But  Edouard's  slightest  smile  would  have  wounded  him; 
and  as  the  passionate  and  tumultuous  feelings  which  were  shak- 
ing him  could  not  have  been  expressed  without  the  risk  of  seem- 
ing exaggerated,  he  kept  silence.  He  felt  his  features  harden; 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  72 

he  would  have  liked  to  fling  himself  into  Edouard's  arms  and 
cry.  Edouard  misunderstood  this  silence  of  Olivier's  and  the 
look  of  sternness  on  his  face;  he  loved  him  far  too  much  to  be 
able  to  behave  with  any  ease.  He  hardly  dared  look  at  Olivier, 
whom  he  longed  to  take  in  his  arms  and  fondle  like  a  child, 
and  when  he  met  his  eyes  and  saw  their  dull  and  lifeless 
expression: 

"Of  course!"  he  said  to  himself.  "I  bore  him — I  bore  him 
to  death.  Poor  child!  He's  just  waiting  for  a  word  from  me  to 
escape."  And  irresistibly  Edouard  said  the  word — out  of  sheer 
pity:  "You'd  better  be  oflF  now.  Your  people  are  expecting  you 
for  lunch,  I'm  sure." 

Olivier,  who  was  thinking  the  same  things,  misunderstood  in 
the  same  way.  He  got  up  in  a  desperate  hurry  and  held  out 
his  hand.  At  least  he  wanted  to  say  to  Edouard:  "Shall  I  see 
you — thee — again  soon?  Shall  we  see  each  other  again  soon?" 
.  .  .  Edouard  was  waiting  for  these  words.  Nothing  came  but 
a  commonplace  "Good-bye!" 


THE  CLOAK-ROOM   TICKET 

The  sun  woke  Bernard.  He  rose  from  his  bench  with  a  violent 
headache.  His  gallant  courage  of  the  morning  had  left  him. 
He  felt  abominably  lonely  and  his  heart  was  swelling  with 
something  brackish  and  bitter  which  he  would  not  call  un- 
happiness,  but  which  brought  the  tears  to  his  eyes.  What  should 
he  do?  Where  should  he  go?  ...  If  his  steps  turned  towards 
St.  Lazare  Station  at  the  time  that  he  knew  Olivier  was  due 
there,  it  was  without  any  definite  purpose  and  merely  with 
the  wish  to  see  his  friend  again.  He  reproached  himself  for 
having  left  so  abruptly  that  morning;  perhaps  Olivier  had  been 
hurt?  .  .  .  Was  he  not  the  creature  in  the  world  he  liked  best? 
.  .  .  When  he  saw  him  arm  in  arm  with  Edouard  a  peculiar 
feeling  made  him  follow  the  pair  and  at  the  same  time  not 
show  himself;  painfully  conscious  of  being  de  trap,  he  would 
yet  have  liked  to  slip  in  between  them.  He  thought  Edouard 
looked  charming;  only  a  little  taller  than  Olivier  and  with  a 
scarcely  less  youthful  figure.  It  was  he  whom  he  made  up  his 
mind  to  address;  he  would  wait  until  Olivier  left  him.  But 
address  him?  Upon  what  pretext? 

It  was  at  this  moment  that  he  caught  sight  of  the  little 
bit  of  crumpled  paper  as  it  escaped  from  Edouard's  hand.  He 
picked  it  up,  saw  that  it  was  a  cloak-room  ticket  ,  .  .  and,  by 
Jove,  here  was  the  wished-for  pretext! 

He  saw  the  two  friends  go  into  a  cafe,  hesitated  a  moment 
in  perplexity,  and  then  continued  his  monologue: 

"Now  a  normal  fathead  would  have  nothing  better  to  do 
than  to  return  this  paper  at  once,"  he  said  to  himself. 

'"How  weary,  stale,  flat  and  unprofitable 
Seem  to  me  all  the  uses  of  this  world!' 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  74 

as  I  have  heard  Hamlet  remark.  Bernard,  Bernard,  what 
thought  is  this  that  is  tickling  you?  It  was  only  yesterday  that 
you  were  rifling  a  drawer.  On  what  path  are  you  entering? 
Consider,  my  boy,  consider.  .  .  .  Consider  that  the  cloak-room 
attendant  who  took  Edouard's  luggage  will  be  gone  to  his  lunch 
at  12  o'clock,  and  that  there  will  be  another  one  on  duty.  And 
didn't  you  promise  your  friend  to  stick  at  nothing?" 

He  reflected,  however,  that  too  much  haste  might  spoil  every- 
thing. The  attendant  might  be  surprised  into  thinking  this 
haste  suspicious;  he  might  consult  the  entry  book  and  think  it 
unnatural  that  a  piece  of  luggage  deposited  in  the  cloak-room 
a  few  minutes  before  twelve,  should  be  taken  out  immediately 
after.  And  besides,  suppose  some  passer-by,  some  busy-body, 
had  seen  him  pick  up  the  bit  of  paper.  .  .  .  Bernard  forced 
himself  to  walk  to  the  Place  de  la  Concorde  without  hurrying — 
in  the  time  it  would  have  taken  another  person  to  lunch.  It 
is  quite  usual,  isn't  it,  to  put  one's  luggage  in  the  cloak-room 
whilst  one  is  lunching  and  to  take  it  out  immediately  after.  ,  .  . 
His  headache  had  gone.  As  he  was  passing  by  a  restaurant 
terrace,  he  boldly  took  a  toothpick  from  one  of  the  little 
bundles  that  were  set  out  on  the  tables,  and  stood  nibbling 
it  at  the  cloak-room  counter,  in  order  to  give  himself  the  air 
of  having  lunched.  He  was  lucky  to  have  in  his  favour  his 
good  looks,  his  well-cut  clothes,  his  distinction,  the  frankness 
of  his  eyes  and  smile,  and  that  indefinable  something  in  the 
whole  appearance  which  denotes  those  who  have  been  brought 
up  in  comfort  and  want  for  nothing.  (But  all  this  gets  rather 
draggled  by  sleeping  on  benches.)  .  .  . 

He  had  a  horrible  turn  when  the  attendant  told  him  there 
were  ten  centimes  to  pay.  He  had  not  a  single,  sou  left.  What 
should  he  do?  The  suit-case  was  there,  on  the  counter.  The 
slightest  sign  of  hesitation  would  give  the  alarm — so  would  his 
want  of  money.  But  the  demon  is  watching  over  him;  he  slips 
between  Bernard's  anxious  fingers,  as  they  go  searching  from 
pocket  to  pocket  with  a  pretence  of  feigned  despair,  a  fifty- 
centime  bit,  which  had  lain  forgotten  since  goodness  knows 
when  in  his  waistcoat  pocket.  Bernard  hands  it  to  the  attendant. 


75  THE  CLOAK-ROOM   TICKET 

He  has  not  shown  a  sign  of  his  agitation.  He  takes  up  the 
suit-case,  and  in  the  simplest,  honestest  fashion  pockets  the 
forty  centimes  change.  Heavens!  How  hot  he  is!  Where  shall 
he  go  now?  His  legs  are  beginning  to  fail  him  and  the  suit- 
case feels  heavy.  What  shall  he  do  with  it?  .  .  .  He  suddenly 
remembers  that  he  has  no  key.  No!  No!  Certainly  not!  He 
will  not  break  open  the  lock;  what  the  devil,  he  isn't  a  thief! 
.  .  .  But  if  he  only  knew  what  was  in  it.  His  arm  is  aching 
and  he  is  perspiring  with  the  heat.  He  stops  for  a  moment 
and  puts  his  burden  down  on  the  pavement.  Of  course  he  has 
every  intention  of  returning  the  wretched  thing  to  its  owner; 
but  he  would  like  to  question  it  first.  He  presses  the  lock  at  a 
venture.  ...  Oh  miracle!  The  two  shells  open  and  disclose  a 
pearl — a  pocket-book,  which  in  its  turn  discloses  a  bundle  of 
bank-notes.  Bernard  seizes  the  pearl  and  shuts  up  the  oyster. 

And  now  that  he  has  the  wherewithal — quick!  a  hotel.  He 
knows  of  one  close  by  in  the  Rue  d'Amsterdam.  He  is  dying 
of  hunger.  But  before  sitting  down  to  table,  he  must  put  his 
suit-case  in  safety.  A  waiter  carries  it  upstairs  before  him; 
three  flights;  a  passage;  a  door  which  he  locks  upon  his  treasure. 
He  goes  down  again. 

Sitting  at  table  in  front  of  a  beefsteak,  Bernard  did  not 
dare  examine  the  pocket-book.  (One  never  knows  who  may  be 
watching  you.)  But  his  left  hand  amorously  caressed  it,  lying 
snug  in  his  inside  pocket. 

"How  to  make  Edouard  understand  that  I'm  not  a  thief — 
that's  the  trouble.  What  kind  of  fellow  is  Edouard?  Perhaps 
the  suit-case  may  shed  a  little  light  upon  that.  Attractive — 
so  much  is  certain.  But  there  are  heaps  of  attractive  fellows 
who  have  no  taste  for  practical  joking.  If  he  thinks  his  suit- 
case has  been  stolen,  no  doubt  he'll  be  glad  to  see  it  again.  If 
he's  the  least  decent  he'll  be  grateful  to  me  for  bringing  it 
back  to  him.  I  shall  easily  rouse  his  interest.  Let's  eat  the  sweet 
quickly  and  then  go  upstairs  and  examine  the  situation.  Now 
for  the  bill  and  a  soul-stirring  tip  for  the  waiter." 

A  minute  or  two  later  he  was  back  again  in  his  room. 

"Now,   suit-case,   a  word  with   you!  ...  A   morning   suit. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  76 

not  more  than  a  trifle  too  big  for  me,  I  expect.  The  material 
becoming  and  in  good  taste.  Linen;  toilet  things.  I'm  not  very 
sure  that  I  shall  give  any  of  all  this  back.  But  what  proves 
that  I'm  not  a  thief  is  that  these  papers  interest  me  a  great 
deal  more  than  anything  else.  We'll  begin  by  reading  this." 

This  was  the  note-book  into  which  Edouard  had  slipped 
Laura's  menancholy  letter.  We  have  already  seen  the  first 
pages;  this  is  what  followed.

EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:   GEORGE   MOLINIER 

Nov.  1st. — A  fortnight  ago  .  .  . 

— it  was  a  mistake  not  to  have  noted  it  down  at  once.  It 
was  not  so  much  that  I  hadn't  time  as  that  my  heart  was  still 
full  of  Laura — or,  to  be  more  accurate,  I  did  not  wish  to  dis- 
tract my  thoughts  from  her;  moreover,  I  do  not  care  to  note 
anything  here  that  is  casual  or  fortuitous,  and  at  that  time  I 
did  not  think  that  what  I  am  going  to  relate  could  lead  to 
anything,  or  be,  as  people  say,  of  any  consequence;  at  any 
rate,  I  would  not  admit  it  to  myself  and  it  was,  in  a  way, 
to  prove  the  unimportance  of  this  incident  that  I  refrained 
from  mentioning  it  in  my  journal.  But  I  feel  more  and  more — 
it  would  be  vain  to  deny  it — that  it  is  Olivier's  figure  that 
has  now  become  the  magnet  of  my  thoughts,  that  their  current 
sets  towards  him  and  that  without  taking  him  into  account 
I  shall  be  able  neither  to  explain  nor  to  understand  myself 
properly. 

I  was  coming  back  that  morning  from  Perrin's,  the  publish- 
er's, where  I  had  been  seeing  about  the  press  copies  of  the  fresh 
edition  of  my  old  book.  As  the  weather  was  fine,  I  was  dawdling 
back  along  the  quays  until  it  should  be  time  for  lunch. 

A  little  before  getting  to  Vanier's,  I  stopped  in  front  of  a 
second-hand  bookseller's.  It  was  not  so  much  the  books  that 
interested  me  as  a  small  schoolboy,  about  thirteen  years  old, 
who  was  rummaging  the  outside  shelves  under  the  placid  eye 
of  a  shop  assistant,  who  sat  watching  on  a  rush-bottomed  chair 
in  the  door-way.  I  pretended  to  be  examining  the  bookstall,  but 
I  too  kept  a  watch  on  the  youngster  out  of  the  corner  of  my 
eye.  He  was  dressed  in  a  threadbare  overcoat,  the  sleeves  of 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  78 

which  were  too  short  and  showed  his  other  sleeves  below  them. 
Its  side  pocket  was  gaping,  though  it  was  obviously  empty;  a 
corner  of  the  stuff  had  given  way.  I  reflected  that  this  coat  must 
have  already  seen  service  with  several  elder  brothers  and  that 
his  brothers  and  he  must  have  been  in  the  habit  of  stuffing  a 
great  many,  too  many,  things  into  their  pockets.  I  reflected  too 
that  his  mother  must  be  either  very  neglectful  or  very  busy  not 
to  have  mended  it.  But  just  then  the  youngster  turned  round 
a  little  and  1  saw  that  the  pocket  on  the  other  side  was  coarsely 
darned  with  stout  black  thread.  And  I  seemed  to  hear  the  ma- 
ternal exhortations:  "Don't  put  two  books  at  a  time  into  your 
pocket;  you'll  ruin  your  overcoat.  Your  pocket's  all  torn  again. 
Next  time,  I  warn  you,  I  shan't  darn  it.  Just  look  what  a  sight 
you  are!  .  .  ."  Things  which  my  own  poor  mother  used  to  say 
to  me,  too,  and  to  which  I  paid  no  more  attention  than  he.  The 
overcoat  was  unbuttoned  and  my  eye  was  attracted  by  a  kind 
of  decoration,  a  bit  of  ribbon,  or  rather  a  yellow  rosette  which 
he  was  wearing  in  the  buttonhole  of  his  inside  coat.  I  put  all 
this  down  for  the  sake  of  discipline  .and  for  the  very  reason 
that  it  bores  me  to  put  it  down. 

At  a  certain  moment  the  man  on  the  chair  was  called  into 
the  shop;  he  did  not  stay  more  than  a  second  and  came  back  to 
his  chair  at  once,  but  that  second  was  enough  to  allow  the  boy  to 
slip  the  book  he  was  holding  into  his  pocket;  then  he  immedi- 
ately began  scanning  the  shelves  again  as  if  nothing  had  hap- 
pened. At  the  same  time  he  was  uneasy;  he  raised  his  head, 
caught  me  looking  at  him  and  understood  that  I  had  seen  him. 
At  any  rate,  he  said  to  himself  that  I  might  have  seen  him; 
he  was  probably  not  quite  certain;  but  in  his  uncertainty  he  lost 
all  his  assurance,  blushed  and  started  a  little  performance  in 
which  he  tried  to  appear  quite  at  his  ease,  but  which,  on  the 
contrary,  showed  extreme  embarrassment.  I  did  not  take  my 
eyes  off  him.  He  took  the  purloined  book  out  of  his  pocket, 
thrust  it  back  again,  walked  away  a  few  steps,  pulled  out  of 
his  inside  pocket  a  wretched  little  pocket-book,  in  which  he 
pretended  to  look  for  some  imaginary  money;  made  a  face,  a 
kind  of  theatrical  grimace,  aimed  at  me,  and  signifying,  "Drat! 


79  GEORGE  MOLINIER 

Not  enough!"  and  with  a  little  shade  of  surprise  in  it  as  well, 
"Odd!  I  thought  I  had  enough!"  The  whole  thing  slightly  ex- 
aggerated, slightly  overdone,  as  when  an  actor  is  afraid  of  not 
being  understood.  Finally,  under  the  pressure  of  my  look,  I 
might  almost  say,  he  went  back  to  the  shelf,  pulled  the  book, 
this  time  decidedly,  out  of  his  pocket  and  put  it  back  in  its 
place.  It  was  done  so  naturally  that  the  assistant  noticed 
nothing.  Then  the  boy  raised  his  head  again,  hoping  that  at  last 
he  would  be  rid  of  me.  But  not  at  all;  my  look  was  still  upon 
him,  like  the  eye  that  watched  Cain — only  my  eye  was  a  smil- 
ing one.  I  determined  to  speak  to  him  and  waited  until  he 
should  have  left  the  bookstall  before  going  up  to  him;  but  he 
didn't  budge  and  still  stood  planted  in  front  of  the  books,  and 
I  understood  that  he  wouldn't  budge  as  long  as  1  kept  gazing  at 
him.  So,  as  at  Puss  in  the  Corner,  when  one  tries  to  entice  the 
pretence  quarry  to  change  places,  I  moved  a  little  away  as  if  I 
had  seen  enough  and  he  started  off  at  once  in  his  own  direc- 
tion; but  he  had  no  sooner  got  into  the  open  than  I  caught  him 
up. 

"What  was  that  book?"  I  asked  him  out  of  the  blue,  at  the 
same  time  putting  as  much  amenity  as  I  could  into  my  voice 
and  expression. 

He  looked  me  full  in  the  face  and  I  felt  all  his  suspicions 
drop  from  him.  He  was  not  exactly  handsome,  perhaps,  but 
what  charming  eyes  he  had!  I  saw  every  kind  of  feeling  wa- 
vering in  their  depths  like  water  weeds  at  the  bottom  of  a 
stream. 

"It's  a  guide-book  for  Algeria.  But  it's  too  dear.  I'm  not  rich 
enough." 

"How  much?" 

"Two  francs  fifty." 

"All  the  same,  if  you  hadn't  seen  me,  you'd  have  made  off 
with  the  book  in  your  pocket." 

The  little  fellow  made  a  movement  of  indignation.  He  ex- 
postulated in  a  tone  of  extreme  vulgarity: 

"Well,  I  never!  What  d'you  take  me  for?  A  thief?"  But  he 
said  it  with  such  conviction  that  I  almost  began  to  doubt  my 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  80 

own  eyes.  I  felt  that  I  should  lose  my  hold  over  him  if  I  went 
on.  I  took  three  coins  out  of  my  pocket: 

"All  right!  Go  and  buy  it.  I  II  wait  for  you." 

Two  minutes  later  he  came  back  turning  over  the  pages  of 
the  coveted  work.  I  took  it  out  of  his  hands.  It  was  an  old 
guide-book  of  the  year  1871. 

"What's  the  good  of  that?"  I  said  as  I  handed  it  back  to 
him.  "It's  too  old.  It's  of  no  use." 

He  protested  that  it  was — that,  besides,  recent  guide-books 
were  much  too  dear,  and  that  for  all  he  should  do  with  it  the 
maps  of  this  one  were  good  enough.  I  don't  attempt  to  quote  his 
words,  which  would  lose  their  savour  without  the  extraordinar- 
ily vulgar  accent  with  which  he  said  them  and  which  was  all  the 
more  amusing  because  his  sentences  were  not  turned  without  a 
certain  elegance. 

This  episode  must  be  very  much  shortened.  Precision  in  the 
reader's  imagination  should  be  obtained  not  by  accumulating 
details  but  by  two  or  three  touches  put  in  exactly  the  right 
places.  I  expect  for  that  matter  that  it  would  be  a  better  plan 
to  make  the  boy  tell  the  story  himself;  his  point  of  view  is  of 
more  signification  than  mine.  He  is  flattered  and  at  the  same 
time  made  uncomfortable  by  the  attention  I  pay  him.  But  the 
weight  of  my  look  makes  him  deviate  a  little  from  his  own  real 
direction.  A  personality  which  is  over  tender  and  still  too  young 
to  be  conscious  of  itself,  takes  shelter  behind  an  attitude. 
Nothing  is  more  difficult  to  observe  than  creatures  in  the  period 
of  formation.  One  ought  to  look  at  them  only  sideways — in 
profile. 

The  youngster  suddenly  declared  that  what  he  liked  best  was 
geography!  I  suspected  that  an  instinct  for  vagabonding  was 
concealed  behind  this  liking. 

"You'd  like  to  go  to  those  parts?"  I  asked. 

"Wouldn't  I  ?"  he  answered,  shrugging  his  shoulders. 

The  idea  crossed  my  mind  that  he  was  unhappy  at  home.  I 
asked  him  if  he  lived  with  his  parents.  "Yes."  Didn't  he  get 
on  with  them?  He  protested  rather  lukewarmly  that  he  did.

He  seemed  afraid  that  he  had  given  himself  away  by  what  he 
had  just  said.  He  added: 

"Why  do  you  ask  that?" 

"Oh,  for  nothing,"  I  answered,  and  then,  touching  the  yellow 
ribbon  in  his  buttonhole,  "What's  that?" 

"It's  a  ribbon.  Can't  you  see?" 

My  questions  evidently  annoyed  him.  He  turned  towards  me 
abruptly  and  almost  vindictively,  and  in  a  jeering,  insolent 
voice  of  which  I  should  never  have  thought  him  capable  and 
which  absolutely  turned  me  sick: 

"1  say  ...  do  you  often  go  about  picking  up  schoolboys?" 

Then  as  I  was  stammering  out  some  kind  of  a  confused  an- 
swer, he  opened  the  satchel  he  was  carrying  under  his  arm  to 
slip  his  purchase  into  it.  It  held  his  lesson  books  and  one  or 
two  copy-books,  all  covered  with  blue  paper.  1  took  one  out; 
it  was  a  history  note-book.  Its  small  owner  had  written  his  name 
on  it  in  large  letters.  My  heart  gave  a  jump  as  I  recognized 
that  it  was  my  nephew's: 

GEORGE  MOLINIER. 

(Bernard's  heart  gave  a  jump  too  as  he  read  these  lines  and 
the  whole  story  began  to  interest  him  prodigiously.) 

It  will  be  difficult  to  get  it  accepted  that  the  character  who 
stands  for  me  in  The  Counterfeiters  can  have  kept  on  good 
terms  with  his  sister  and  yet  not  have  known  her  children.  I 
have  always  had  the  greatest  difficulty  in  tampering  with  real 
facts.  Even  to  alter  the  colour  of  a  person's  hair  seems  to  me 
a  piece  of  cheating  which  must  lessen  the  verisimilitude  of  the 
truth.  Everything  hangs  together  and  I  always  feel  such  a  subtle 
interdependence  between  all  the  facts  life  offers  me,  that  it 
seems  to  me  impossible  to  change  a  single  one  without  modify- 
ing the  whole.  And  yet  1  can  hardly  explain  that  this  boy's 
mother  is  only  my  half-sister  by  a  first  marriage  of  my  father's; 
that  I  never  saw  her  during  the  whole  time  my  parents  were 
alive;  that  we  were  brought  into  contact  by  business  relating 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  82 

to  the  property  they  left.  ...  All  this  is  indispensable,  how- 
ever, and  I  don't  see  what  else  I  can  invent  in  order  to  avoid 
being  indiscreet.  I  knew  that  my  half-sister  had  three  sons;  I 
had  met  the  eldest — a  medical  student — but  I  had  caught  only 
a  sight  even  of  him,  as  he  has  been  obliged  to  interrupt  his 
studies  on  account  of  a  threatening  of  tuberculosis  and  has  gone 
to  some  place  in  the  South  for  treatment.  The  two  others  were 
never  there  when  I  went  to  see  Pauline;  the  one  who  was  now 
before  me  was  certainly  the  youngest.  I  showed  no  trace  of 
astonishment,  but,  taking  an  abrupt  leave  of  young  George 
after  learning  that  he  was  going  home  to  lunch,  I  jumped  into 
a  taxi  in  order  to  get  to  Rue  Notre-Dame-des-Champs  before 
him.  I  expected  that  at  this  hour  of  the  morning  Pauline  would 
keep  me  to  lunch — which  was  exactly  what  happened;  I  had 
brought  away  a  copy  of  my  book  from  Perrin's,  and  made  up 
my  mind  to  present  it  to  her  as  an  excuse  for  my  unexpected 
visit. 

It  was  the  first  time  I  had  taken  a  meal  at  Pauline's.  I  was 
wrong  to  fight  shy  of  my  brother-in-law.  I  can  hardly  believe 
that  he  is  a  very  remarkable  jurist,  but  when  we  are  together 
he  has  the  sense  to  keep  off  his  shop  as  much  as  I  off  mine,  so 
that  we  get  on  very  well. 

Naturally  when  I  got  there  that  morning  I  did  not  breathe  a 
word  of  my  recent  meeting: 

"It  will  give  me  an  opportunity,  I  hope,  of  making  my 
nephews'  acquaintance,"  I  said,  when  Pauline  asked  me  to  stay 
to  lunch.  'Tor,  you  know,  there  are  two  of  them  I  have  never 
met." 

"Olivier  will  be  a  little  late,"  she  said;  "he  has  a  lesson;  we 
will  begin  lunch  without  him.  But  I've  just  heard  George  come 
in,  I'll  call  him."  And  going  to  the  door  of  the  adjoining  room, 
"George,"  she  said,  "come  and  say  'how-do-you-do'  to  your 
uncle." 

The  boy  came  up  and  held  out  his  hand.  I  kissed  him  .  .  . 
children's  power  of  dissembling  fills  me  with  amazement — he 
showed  no  surprise;  one  would  have  supposed  he  did  not 
recognize  me.  He  simply  blushed  deeply;  but  his  mother  must 


83  GEORGE   MOLINIER 

have  thought  it  was  from  shyness.  I  suspected  he  was  embar- 
rassed at  this  meeting  with  the  morning's  'tec,'  for  he  left  us 
almost  immediately  and  went  back  to  the  next  room — the 
dining-room,  which  I  understood  is  used  by  the  boys  as  a 
schoolroom  between  meals.  He  reappeared,  however,  shortly 
after,  when  his  father  came  into  the  room,  and  took  advantage 
of  the  moment  when  we  were  going  into  the  dining-room,  to 
come  up  to  me  and  seize  hold  of  my  hand  without  his  parents' 
seeing.  At  first  I  thought  it  was  a  sign  of  good  fellowship  which 
amused  me,  but  no!  He  opened  my  hand  as  I  was  clasping  his, 
slipped  into  it  a  little  note  which  he  had  obviously  just  written, 
then  closed  my  fingers  over  it  and  gave  them  a  tight  squeeze. 
Needless  to  say  I  played  up  to  him;  I  hid  the  little  note  in  my 
pocket  and  it  was  not  till  after  lunch  that  I  was  able  to  take  it 
out.  This  is  what  I  read: 

"//  you  tell  my  parents  the  story  of  the  hook,  I  shall"  (he 
had  crossed  out  "detest  you")  "say  that  you  solicited  we." 

And  at  the  bottom  of  the  page: 

"I  come  out  of  school  every  morning  at  10  o'clock." 

Interrupted  yesterday  by  a  visit  from  X.  His  conversation 
upset  me  considerably. 

Have  been  reflecting  a  great  deal  on  what  X.  said.  He  knows 
nothing  about  my  life,  but  I  gave  him  a  long  account  of  the 
plan  of  my  Counterfeiters.  His  advice  is  always  salutary,  be- 
cause his  point  of  view  is  diff'erent  from  mine.  He  is  afraid  that 
my  work  may  be  too  factitious,  that  I  am  in  danger  of  letting 
go  the  real  subject  for  the  shadow  of  the  subject  in  my  brain. 
What  makes  me  uneasy  is  to  feel  that  life  (my  life)  at  this 
juncture  is  parting  company  from  my  work,  and  my  work  mov- 
ing away  from  my  life.  But  I  couldn't  say  that  to  him.  Up  till 
now — as  is  right — my  tastes,  my  feelings,  my  personal  experi- 
ences have  all  gone  to  feed  my  writings;  in  my  best  contrived 
phrases  I  still  felt  the  beating  of  my  heart.  But  henceforth  the 
link  is  broken  between  what  I  think  and  what  I  feel.  And  I 
wonder  whether  this  impediment  which  prevents  my  heart  from 
speaking  is  not  the  real  cause  that  is  driving  my  work  into 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  84 

abstraction  and  artificiality.  As  I  was  reflecting  on  this,  the 
meaning  of  the  fable  of  Apollo  and  Daphne  suddenly  flashed 
upon  me:  happy,  thought  I,  the  man  who  can  clasp  in  one  and 
the  same  embrace  the  laurel  and  the  object  of  his  love. 

I  related  my  meeting  with  George  at  such  length  that  I  was 
obliged  to  stop  at  the  moment  when  Olivier  came  on  the  scene. 
I  began  this  tale  only  to  speak  of  him  and  I  have  managed  to 
speak  only  of  George.  But  now  that  the  moment  has  come  to 
speak  of  Olivier  I  understand  that  it  was  desire  to  defer  that 
moment  which  was  the  cause  of  all  my  slowness.  As  soon  as  I 
saw  him  that  first  day,  as  soon  as  he  sat  down  to  the  family 
meal,  at  my  first  look — or  rather  at  his  first  look — I  felt  that 
look  of  his  take  possession  of  me  wholly,  and  that  my  life  was 
no  longer  mine  to  dispose  of. 

Pauline  presses  me  to  go  and  see  her  oftener.  She  begs  me 
urgently  to  interest  myself  in  her  boys.  She  gives  me  to  under- 
stand that  their  father  knows  very  little  about  them.  The  more 
I  talk  to  her,  the  more  charming  I  think  her.  1  cannot  under- 
stand how  I  can  have  been  so  long  without  seeing  more  of  her. 
The  children  have  been  brought  up  as  Catholics;  but  she  re- 
members her  early  Protestant  training,  and  though  she  left 
our  father's  home  at  the  time  my  mother  entered  it,  I  discover 
many  points  of  resemblance  between  her  and  me.  She  sends  her 
boys  to  school  with  Laura's  parents,  with  whom  I  myself 
boarded  for  so  long.  This  school  (half  a  school  and  half  a  board- 
ing house)  was  founded  by  old  Monsieur  Azais  (a  friend  of  my 
father's)  who  is  still  the  head  of  it.  Though  he  started  life  as  a 
pastor,  he  prides  himself  on  keeping  his  school  free  from  any 
denominational  tendency — in  my  time  there  were  even  Turks 
there. 

Pauline  says  she  has  good  news  from  the  sanatorium  where 
Vincent  is  staying;  he  has  almost  completely  recovered.  She 
tells  me  that  she  writes  to  him  about  me  and  that  she  wishes  I 
knew  him  better;  for  I  have  barely  seen  him.  She  builds  great 
hopes  on  her  eldest  son;  the  family  is  stinting  itself  in  order  to 
enable  him  to  set  up  for  himself  shortly— that  is,  to  have  rooms 
of  his  own  where  he  can  receive  his  patients.  In  the  mean  time 


85  GEORGE  MOLINIER 

she  has  managed  to  set  aside  a  part  of  their  small  apartment  for 
him,  by  putting  Olivier  and  George  on  the  floor  below  in  a  room 
that  happened  to  be  vacant.  The  great  question  is  whether  the 
state  of  Vincent's  health  will  oblige  him  to  give  up  being  house- 
physician. 

To  tell  the  truth  I  take  very  little  interest  in  Vincent,  and  if 
I  talk  to  his  mother  about  him,  it  is  really  to  please  her  and  so 
that  we  can  then  go  on  to  talk  about  Olivier  at  greater  length. 
As  for  George,  he  fights  shy  of  me,  hardly  answers  when  I  speak 
to  him,  and  gives  me  a  look  of  indescribable  suspicion  when 
we  happen  to  pass  each  other.  He  seems  unable  to  forgive  me 
for  not  having  gone  to  meet  him  outside  the  lycee — or  to  for- 
give himself  for  his  advances  to  me. 

I  don't  see  much  of  Olivier  either.  When  I  visit  his  mother,  I 
don't  dare  go  into  the  room  where  I  know  he  is  at  work;  if  I 
meet  him  by  chance,  I  am  so  awkward  and  shy  that  I  find 
nothing  to  say  to  him,  and  that  makes  me  so  unhappy  that  I 
prefer  to  call  on  his  mother  at  the  times  when  I  know  he  will 
be  out. 


EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:   LAURA'S  WEDDING 

hlqv.  2nd. — Long  conversation  with  Douviers.  We  met  at 
Laura's  parents',  and  he  left  at  the  same  time  as  I  and  walked 
across  the  Luxembourg  Gardens  with  me.  He  is  preparing  a 
thesis  on  Wordsworth,  but  from  the  few  words  he  let  fall.  I  feel 
certain  that  he  misses  the  most  characteristic  points  of  Words- 
worth's poetry;  he  had  better  have  chosen  Tennyson.  There  is 
something  or  other  inadequate  about  Douviers — something  ab- 
stract and  simple-minded  and  credulous.  He  always  takes  every- 
thing— people  and  things — for  what  they  set  out  to  be.  Perhaps 
because  he  himself  never  sets  out  to  be  anything  but  v/hat  he  is. 

"I  know,"  he  said  to  me,  "that  you  are  Laura's  best  friend. 
No  doubt  I  ought  to  be  a  little  jealous  of  you.  But  I  can't  be. 
On  the  contrary  everything  she  has  told  me  about  you  has 
made  me  understand  her  better  herself  and  wish  to  become  your 
friend.  I  asked  her  the  other  day  if  you  didn't  bear  me  too  much 
of  a  grudge  for  marrying  her.  She  answered  on  the  contrary, 
that  you  had  advised  her  to."  (I  really  think  he  said  it  just 
as  flatly  as  that.)  "I  should  like  to  thank  you  for  it,  and  I  hope 
you  won't  think  it  ridiculous,  for  I  really  do  so  most  sincerely," 
he  added,  forcing  a  smile  but  with  a  trembling  voice  and  tears 
in  his  eyes. 

I  didn't  know  what  to  answer  him,  for  I  felt  far  less  moved 
than  I  should  have  been,  and  incapable  of  reciprocating  his 
effusion.  He  must  have  thought  me  a  little  stony;  but  he  irri- 
tated me.  Nevertheless  I  pressed  his  hand  as  warmly  as  I  could 
when  he  held  it  out  to  me.  These  scenes,  when  one  of  the  parties 
offers  more  of  his  heart  than  the  other  wants,  are  always  pain- 
ful. No  doubt  he  thought  he  should  capture  my  sympathy.  If 
he  had  been  a  little  more  perspicacious  he  would  have  felt  he

was  being  cheated;  but  I  saw  that  he  was  both  overcome  by 
gratitude  for  his  own  nobility  and  persuaded  that  he  had  raised 
a  response  to  it  in  me.  As  for  me  I  said  nothing,  and  as  my 
silence  perhaps  made  him  feel  uncomfortable:  "I  count,"  he 
added,  "on  her  being  transplanted  to  Cambridge,  to  prevent 
her  from  making  comparisons  which  might  be  disadvantageous 
to  me," 

What  did  he  mean  by  that?  I  did  my  best  not  to  understand. 
Perhaps  he  wanted  me  to  protest.  But  that  would  only  have 
sunk  us  deeper  into  the  bog.  He  is  one  of  those  shy  people 
who  cannot  endure  silences  and  who  think  they  must  fill  them 
by  being  exaggeratedly  forthcoming — the  people  who  say  to 
you  afterwards,  "I  have  always  been  open  with  you."  The 
deuce  they  have!  But  the  important  thing  is  not  so  much  to  be 
open  oneself  as  to  allow  the  other  person  to  be  so.  He  ought  to 
have  realized  that  his  openness  was  the  very  thing  that  pre- 
vented mine. 

But  if  I  cannot  be  a  friend  of  his,  at  any  rate  I  think  he  will 
make  Laura  an  excellent  husband;  for  in  reality  what  I  am 
reproaching  him  with  are  his  qualities.  We  went  on  to  talk  of 
Cambridge,  where  I  have  promised  to  pay  them  a  visit. 

What  absurd  need  had  Laura  to  talk  to  him  about  me? 

What  an  admirable  thing  in  women  is  their  need  for  devo- 
tion! The  man  they  love  is  as  a  rule  a  kind  of  clothes-peg  on 
which  to  hang  their  love.  How  easily  and  sincerely  Laura  has 
effected  the  transposition!  I  understand  that  she  should  marry 
Douviers;  I  was  one  of  the  first  to  advise  it.  But  I  had  the  right 
to  hope  for  a  little  grief. 

Some  reviews  of  my  book  to  hand.  The  qualities  which  people 
are  the  most  willing  to  grant  me  are  just  the  very  ones  I  most 
detest.  Was  I  right  to  republish  this  old  stuff?  It  responds  to 
nothing  that  I  care  for  at  present.  But  it  is  only  at  present  that 
I  see  it  does  not.  I  don't  so  much  think  that  I  have  actually 
changed,  as  that  I  am  only  just  beginning  to  be  aware  of  my- 
self. Up  till  now  I  did  not  know  who  I  was.  Is  it  possible  that 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  88 

I  am  always  in  need  of  another  being  to  act  as  a  plate- 
developer?  This  book  of  mine  had  crystallized  according  to 
Laura;  and  that  is  why  I  will  not  allow  it  to  be  my  present 
portrait. 

An  insight,  composed  of  sympathy,  which  would  enable  us 
to  be  in  advance  of  the  seasons — is  this  denied  us?  What  are 
the  problems  which  will  exercise  the  minds  of  to-morrow?  It  is 
for  them  that  I  desire  to  write.  To  provide  food  for  curiosities 
still  unformed,  to  satisfy  requirements  not  yet  defined,  so  that 
the  child  of  to-day  may  be  astonished  to-morrow  to  find  me  in 
his  path. 

How  glad  I  am  to  feel  in  Olivier  so  much  curiosity,  so  much 
impatient  want  of  satisfaction  with  the  past.  .  .  . 

I  sometimes  think  that  poetry  is  the  only  thing  that  interests 
him.  And  I  feel  as  I  re-read  our  poets  through  his  eyes,  how  few 
there  are  who  have  let  themselves  be  guided  by  a  feeling  for 
art  rather  than  by  their  hearts  or  minds.  The  odd  thing  is 
that  when  Oscar  Molinier  showed  me  some  of  Olivier's  verses, 
I  advised  the  boy  to  let  himself  be  guided  by  the  words  rather 
than  force  them  into  submission.  And  now  it  seems  to  me  that 
it  is  I  who  am  learning  it  from  him. 

How  depressingly,  tiresomely  and  ridiculously  sensible  every- 
thing that  I  have  hitherto  written  seems  to  be  to-day ! 

Ncrv.  5th. — The  wedding  ceremony  is  over.  It  took  place 
in  the  little  chapel  in  Rue  Madame,  to  which  I  have  not  been 
for  a  long  time  past.  The  whole  of  the  Vedel-Azais  families  were 
present. — Laura's  grandfather,  father  and  mother,  her  two  sis- 
ters, her  young  brother,  besides  quantities  of  uncles,  aunts  and 
cousins.  The  Douviers  family  was  represented  by  three  aunts  in 
deep  mourning  (they  would  have  certainly  been  nuns  if  they 
had  been  Catholics).  They  all  three  live  together,  and  Douviers, 
since  his  parents'  death,  has  lived  with  them.  Aza'is's  pupils  sat 
in  the  gallery.  The  rest  of  the  chapel  was  filled  with  the  friends 
of  the  family.  From  my  place  near  the  door  I  saw  my  sister 
with  Olivier.  George,  I  suppose,  was  in  the  gallery  with  his 


89  LAURA'S  WEDDING 

schoolfellows.  Old  La  Perouse  was  at  the  harmonium.  His  face 
has  aged,  but  finer,  nobler  than  ever — though  his  eye  had  lost 
that  admirable  fire  and  spirit  I  found  so  infectious  in  the  days 
when  he  used  to  give  me  piano  lessons.  Our  eyes  met  and  there 
was  so  much  sadness  in  the  smile  he  gave  me  that  I  determined 
not  to  let  him  leave  v^-ithout  speaking  to  him.  Some  persons 
moved  and  left  an  empty  place  beside  Pauline.  Olivier  at  once 
beckoned  to  me,  and  pushed  his  mother  aside  so  that  I  might 
sit  next  him;  then  he  took  my  hand  and  held  it  for  a  long 
time  in  his.  It  is  the  first  time  he  has  been  so  friendly  with  me. 
He  kept  his  eyes  shut  during  the  whole  of  the  minister's  inter- 
minable address,  so  that  I  was  able  to  take  a  long  look  at  him; 
he  is  like  the  sleeping  shepherd  in  a  bas-relief  in  the  Naples 
Museum,  of  which  I  have  a  photograph  on  my  writing  desk. 
I  should  have  thought  he  was  asleep  himself,  if  it  hadn't  been 
for  the  quivering  of  his  fingers.  His  hand  fluttered  in  mine  like 
a  captured  bird. 

The  old  pastor  thought  it  his  duty  to  retrace  the  whole  of 
the  Azais  family  history,  beginning  with  the  grandfather, 
with  whom  he  had  been  at  school  in  Strasburg  before  the  war, 
and  who  had  also  been  a  fellow-student  of  his  later  on  at  the 
faculty  of  theology.  I  thought  he  would  never  get  to  the  end 
of  a  complicated  sentence  in  which  he  tried  to  explain  that  in 
becoming  the  head  of  a  school  and  devoting  himself  to  the 
education  of  young  children,  his  friend  had,  so  to  speak,  never 
left  the  ministry.  Then  the  next  generation  had  its  turn.  He 
went  on  to  speak  with  equal  edification  of  the  Douviers  family, 
though  he  didn't  seem  to  know  much  about  them.  The  excel- 
lence of  his  sentiments  palliated  the  deficiency  of  his  oratory 
and  I  heard  several  members  of  the  congregation  blowing  their 
noses.  I  should  have  liked  to  know  what  Olivier  was  thinking; 
I  reflected  that  as  he  had  been  brought  up  a  Catholic,  the 
Protestant  service  must  be  new  to  him  and  that  this  was  prob- 
ably his  first  visit  to  the  chapel.  The  singular  faculty  of  de- 
personali^ation  which  I  possess  and  which  enables  me  to  feel 
other  people's  emotions  as  if  they  were  my  own,  compelled  me, 
as  it  were,  to  enter  into  Olivier's  feelings — those  that  I  imagined 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  90 

him  to  be  experiencing;  and  though  he  kept  his  eyes  shut,  or 
perhaps  for  that  very  reason,  I  felt  as  if,  like  him,  1  were  seeing 
for  the  first  time  the  bare  walls,  the  abstract  and  chilly  light 
which  fell  upon  the  congregation,  the  relentless  outline  of  the 
pulpit  on  the  background  of  the  white  wall,  the  straightness  of 
the  lines,  the  rigidity  of  the  columns  which  support  the  gallery, 
the  whole  spirit  of  this  angular  and  colourless  architecture  and 
its  repellent  want  of  grace,  its  uncompromising  inflexibility, 
its  parsimony.  It  can  only  be  because  1  have  been  accustomed 
to  it  since  childhood,  that  I  have  not  felt  all  this  sooner.  ...  I 
suddenly  found  myself  thinking  of  my  religious  awakening  and 
my  first  fervours;  of  Laura  and  the  Sunday  school  where  we 
used  to  meet  and  of  which  we  were  both  monitors,  of  our  zeal 
and  our  inability,  in  the  ardour  which  consumed  all  that  was 
impure  in  us,  to  distinguish  the  part  which  belonged  to  the 
other  and  the  part  that  was  God's.  And  then  1  fell  to  regretting 
that  Olivier  had  never  known  this  early  starvation  of  the  senses 
which  drives  the  soul  so  perilously  far  beyond  appearances — 
that  his  memories  were  not  like  mine;  but  to  feel  him  so  distant 
from  the  whole  thing,  helped  me  to  escape  from  it  myself.  I 
passionately  pressed  the  hand  which  he  had  left  in  mine,  but 
which  just  then  he  withdrew  abruptly.  He  opened  his  eyes  to 
look  at  me,  and  then,  with  a  boyish  smile  of  roguish  playful- 
ness, which  mitigated  the  extraordinary  gravity  of  his  brow, 
he  leant  towards  me  and  whispered — while  just  at  that  moment 
the  minister  was  reminding  all  Christians  of  their  duties,  and 
lavishing  advice,  precepts  and  pious  exhortations  upon  the 
newly  married  couple: 

"I  don't  care  a  damn  about  any  of  it.  I'm  a  Catholic." 
Everything  about  him  is  attractive  to  me — and  mysterious. 

At  the  sacristy  door,  1  came  across  old  La  Perouse.  He  said,  a 
little  sadly  but  without  any  trace  of  reproach:  "You've  almost 
forgotten  me,  I  think." 

I  mentioned  some  kind  of  occupation  or  other  as  an  excuse 
for  having  been  so  long  without  going  to  see  him  and  promised 


91  LAURA'S  WEDDING 

to  go  the  day  after  to-morrow.  I  tried  to  persuade  him  to 
come  back  with  me  to  the  reception,  which  the  Azaises  were 
giving  after  the  ceremony  and  to  which  I  was  invited;  but  he 
said  he  was  in  too  sombre  a  mood  and  was  afraid  of  meeting 
too  many  people  to  whom  he  ought  to  speak,  and  would  not  be 
able  to. 

Pauline  went  away  with  George  and  left  me  with  Olivier. 

"1  trust  him  to  your  care,"  she  said,  laughing;  but  Olivier 
seemed  irritated  and  turned  away  his  face. 

He  drew  me  out  into  the  street.  "I  didn't  know  you  knew 
the  Azaises  so  well." 

He  was  very  much  surprised  when  I  told  him  that  I  had 
boarded  with  them  for  two  years. 

"How  could  you  do  that  rather  than  live  independently — any- 
where else?" 

"It  was  convenient,"  I  answered  vaguely,  for  I  couldn't  say 
that  at  that  time  Laura  was  filling  my  thoughts  and  that  I 
would  have  put  up  with  the  worst  disagreeables  for  the  pleasure 
of  bearing  them  in  her  company. 

"And  weren't  you  suffocated  in  such  a  hole?"  Then,  as  I 
didn't  answer:  "For  that  matter,  I  can't  think  how  I  bear  it 
myself — nor  why  in  the  world  1  am  there.  .  .  .  But  I'm  only 
a  half-boarder.  Even  that's  too  much." 

I  explained  to  him  the  friendship  that  had  existed  between 
his  grandfather  and  the  master  of  the  "hole,"  and  that  his 
mother's  choice  was  no  doubt  guided  by  that. 

"Oh  well,"  he  went  on,  "I  have  no  points  of  comparison;  I 
dare  say  all  these  cramming  places  are  the  same,  and,  most 
likely,  from  what  people  say,  the  others  are  worse.  I  shouldn't 
have  gone  there  at  all  if  I  hadn't  had  to  make  up  the  time  I 
lost  when  I  was  ill.  And  now,  for  a  long  time  past,  I  have  only 
gone  there  for  the  sake  of  Armand." 

Then  I  learnt  that  this  young  brother  of  Laura's  was  his 
schoolfellow.  I  told  Olivier  that  I  hardly  knew  him. 

"And  yet  he's  the  most  intelligent  and  the  most  interesting  of 
the  family." 

"That's  to  say  the  one  who  interests  you  most." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  92 

"No,  no,  I  assure  you,  he's  very  unusual.  If  you  like  we'll  go 
and  see  him  in  his  room.  I  hope  he  won't  be  afraid  to  speak 
before  you." 

We  had  reached  the  pension. 

The  Vedel-Azaises  had  substituted  for  the  traditional  wed- 
ding breakfast  a  less  costly  tea.  Pastor  Vedel's  reception  room 
and  study  had  been  thrown  open  to  the  guests.  Only  a  few 
intimate  friends  were  allowed  into  the  pastoress's  minute  pri- 
vate sitting-room;  but  in  order  to  prevent  it  from  being  over- 
run, the  door  between  it  and  the  reception  room  had  been  locked 
— which  made  Armand  answer,  when  people  asked  him  how 
they  could  get  to  his  mother:  "Through  the  chimney!" 

The  place  was  crowded  and  the  heat  suffocating.  Except  for  a 
few  "members  of  the  teaching  body,"  colleagues  of  Douviers', 
the  society  was  exclusively  Protestant.  The  odour  of  Puritanism 
is  peculiar  to  itself.  In  a  meeting  of  Catholics  or  Jews,  when 
they  let  themselves  go  in  each  other's  company,  the  emanation 
is  as  strong,  and  perhaps  even  more  stifling;  but  among  Cath- 
olics you  find  a  self-appreciation,  and  among  Jews  a  self- 
depreciation,  of  which  Protestants  seem  to  me  very  rarely 
capable.  If  Jews'  noses  are  too  long,  Protestants'  are  bunged  up; 
no  doubt  of  it.  And  I  myself,  all  the  time  I  was  plunged  in 
their  atmosphere,  didn't  perceive  its  peculiar  quality — some- 
thing ineffably  alpine  and  paradisaical  and  foolish. 

At  one  end  of  the  room  was  a  table  set  out  as  a  buffet; 
Rachel,  Laura's  elder  sister,  and  Sarah,  her  younger,  were  serv- 
ing the  tea  with  a  few  of  their  young  lady  friends  to  help 
them.  .  .  . 

As  soon  as  Laura  saw  me,  she  drew  me  into  her  father's  study, 
where  a  considerable  number  of  people  had  already  gathered. 
We  took  refuge  in  the  embrasure  of  a  window,  and  were  able  to 
talk  without  being  overheard.  In  the  days  gone  by,  we  had  writ- 
ten our  two  names  on  the  window  frame. 

"Come  and  see.  They  are  still  there,"  she  said.  "I  don't  think 
anybody  has  ever  noticed  them.  How  old  were  you  then?" 

Underneath  our  names  we  had  written  the  date.  I  calculated: 

"Twenty-eight." 

"And  I  was  sixteen.  Ten  years  ago." 


93  LAURA'S  WEDDING 

The  moment  was  not  very  suitable  for  awakening  these  mem- 
ories; I  tried  to  turn  the  conversation,  while  she  with  a  kind 
of  uneasy  insistence  continually  brought  me  back  to  it;  then 
suddenly,  as  though  she  were  afraid  of  growing  emotional,  she 
asked  me  if  I  remembered  Strouvilhou? 

Strouvilhou  in  those  days  was  an  independent  boarder  who 
was  a  great  nuisance  to  her  parents.  He  was  supposed  to  be  at- 
tending lectures,  but  when  he  was  asked  which  ones,  or  what  ex- 
aminations he  was  studying  for,  he  used  to  answer  negligently: 

"I  vary." 

At  first  people  pretended  to  take  his  insolences  for  jokes, 
in  an  attempt  to  make  them  appear  less  cutting,  and  he  would 
himself  accompany  them  by  a  loud  laugh;  but  his  laugh  soon 
became  more  sarcastic,  and  his  witticisms  more  aggressive,  and 
I  could  never  understand  why  or  how  the  pastor  could  put  up 
with  such  an  individual  as  boarder,  unless  it  were  for  financial 
reasons,  or  because  he  had  a  feeling  that  was  half  aifection,  half 
pity,  for  Strouvilhou,  and  perhaps  a  vague  hope  that  he  might 
end  by  persuading — I  mean  converting — him.  I  couldn't  under- 
stand either  why  Strouvilhou  stayed  on  at  the  pension,  when  he 
might  so  easily  have  gone  elsewhere;  for  he  didn't  appear  to 
have  any  sentimental  reason,  like  me;  perhaps  it  was  because 
of  the  evident  pleasure  he  took  in  his  passages  with  the  poor 
pastor,  who  defended  himself  badly  and  always  got  the  worst 
of  it. 

"Do  you  remember  one  day  when  he  asked  Papa  if  he  kept 
his  coat  on  underneath  his  gown,  when  he  preached?" 

"Yes,  indeed.  He  asked  him  so  insinuatingly  that  your  poor 
father  was  completely  taken  in.  It  was  at  table.  I  can  remember 
it  all  as  if  .  .  ." 

"And  Papa  ingenuously  answered  that  his  gown  was  rather 
thin  and  that  he  was  afraid  of  catching  cold  without  his 
coat." 

"And  then  Strouvilhou's  air  of  deep  distress!  And  how  he  had 
to  be  pressed  before  he  ended  by  saying,  that  of  course  it  was 
of  'very  little  importance,'  but  that  when  your  father  gesticu- 
lated in  preaching,  the  sleeves  of  his  coat  showed  underneath 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  94 

his  gown  and  that  it  had  rather  an  unfortunate  effect  on  some  of 
the  congregation." 

"And  after  that,  poor  Papa  preached  a  whole  sermon  with  his 
arms  glued  to  his  sides,  so  that  none  of  his  oratorical  effects 
came  off." 

"And  the  Sunday  after  that  he  came  home  with  a  bad  cold, 
because  he  had  taken  his  coat  off.  Oh!  and  the  discussion  about 
the  barren  fig-tree  in  the  Gospel  and  about  trees  that  don't 
bear  fruit.  .  .  .  'I'm  not  a  fruit-tree.  What  I  bear  is  shade. 
Monsieur  le  Pasteur,  I  cast  you  into  the  shade.'  " 

"He  said  that  too  at  table." 

"Of  course.  He  never  appeared  except  at  meals." 

"And  he  said  it  in  such  a  spiteful  way  too.  It  was  that  that 
made  grandfather  turn  him  out.  Do  you  remember  how  he  sud- 
denly rose  to  his  feet,  though  he  usually  sat  all  the  time  with 
his  nose  in  his  plate,  and  pointed  to  the  door  with  his  out- 
stretched arm,  and  shouted:  'Leave  the  room!'  " 

"He  looked  enormous — terrifying;  he  was  enraged.  I  really 
believe  Strouvilhou  was  frightened." 

"He  flung  his  napkin  on  to  the  table  and  disappeared.  He 
went  off  without  paying  us;  we  never  saw  him  again." 

"I  wonder  what  has  become  of  him." 

"Poor  grandfather!"  Laura  went  on  rather  sadly.  "How  I  ad- 
mired him  that  day!  He's  very  fond  of  you,  you  know.  You 
ought  to  go  up  and  pay  him  a  little  visit  in  his  study.  I  am 
sure  you  would  give  him  a  great  deal  of  pleasure." 

I  write  down  the  whole  of  this  at  once,  as  I  know  by  experi- 
ence how  difficult  it  is  to  recall  the  tone  of  a  dialogue  after  any 
interval.  But  from  that  moment  I  began  to  listen  to  Laura  less 
attentively.  I  had  just  noticed — some  way  off,  it  is  true — 
Olivier,  whom  I  had  lost  sight  of  when  Laura  drew  me  into  her 
father's  study.  His  eyes  were  shining  and  his  face  extraordi- 
narily animated.  I  heard  afterwards  that  Sarah  had  been  amus- 
ing herself  by  making  him  drink  six  glasses  of  champagne,  in 
succession.  Armand  was  with  him,  and  they  were  both  follow- 
ing Sarah  and  an  English  girl  of  the  same  age  as  Sarah,  who 
has  been  boarding  with  the  family  for  over  a  year — pursuing 


95  LAURA'S  WEDDING 

them  from  group  to  group.  At  last  Sarah  and  her  friend  left  the 
room,  and  through  the  open  door  I  saw  the  two  boys  rush 
upstairs  after  them.  In  my  turn,  I  was  on  the  point  of  leaving 
the  room  in  response  to  Laura's  request,  when  she  made  a 
movement  towards  me: 

"Wait,  Edouard,  there's  one  thing  more  .  .  ."  and  her  voice 
suddenly  became  very  grave.  "It'll  probably  be  a  long  time 
before  we  see  each  other  again.  I  should  like  you  to  say  .  .  . 
I  should  like  to  know  whether  I  may  still  count  on  you  ...  as 
a  friend." 

Never  did  I  feel  more  inclined  to  embrace  her  than  at  that 
moment — but  I  contented  myself  with  kissing  her  hand  ten- 
derly and  impetuously,  and  with  murmuring:  "Come  what  come 
may."  And  then,  to  hide  the  tears  which  I  felt  rising  to  my 
eyes,  I  hurried  off  to  find  Olivier. 

He  was  sitting  on  the  stairs  with  Armand,  watching  for  me 
to  come  out.  He  was  certainly  a  little  tipsy.  He  got  up  and 
pulled  me  by  the  arm: 

"Come  along,"  he  said.  "We're  going  to  have  a  cigarette  in 
Sarah's  room.  She's  expecting  you." 

"In  a  moment.  I  must  first  go  up  and  see  Monsieur  Azais. 
But  I  shall  never  be  able  to  find  the  room." 

"Oh,  yes.  You  know  it  very  well.  It's  Laura's  old  room," 
cried  Armand.  "As  it  was  one  of  the  best  rooms  in  the  house,  it 
was  given  to  the  parlour-boarder,  but  as  she  doesn't  pay  much, 
she  shares  it  with  Sarah.  They  put  in  two  beds  for  form's  sake 
— not  that  there  was  much  need.  .  .  ." 

"Don't  listen  to  him,"  said  Olivier,  laughing  and  giving  him 
a  shove,  "he's  drunk." 

"And  what  about  you?"  answered  Armand.  "Well  then,  you'll 
come,  won't  you?  We  shall  expect  you." 

I  promised  to  rejoin  them. 

Now  that  he  has  cut  his  hair  en  brosse,  old  Azais  doesn't 
look  like  Walt  Whitman  any  more.  He  has  handed  over  the 
first  and  second  floors  of  the  house  to  his  son-in-law.  From  the 
windows  of  his  study  (mahogany,  rep  and  horse-hair  furniture) 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  96 

he  can  look  over  the  play-ground  and  keep  an  eye  on  the 
Dupils'  goings  and  comings. 

"You  see  how  spoilt  I  am,"  he  said,  pointing  to  a  huge  bou- 
cjuet  of  chrysanthemums  which  was  standing  on  the  table,  and 
v/hich  a  mother  of  one  of  the  pupils — an  old  friend  of  the 
family's — had  just  left  for  him.  The  atmosphere  of  the  room 
was  so  austere  that  it  seemed  as  if  any  flower  must  wither  in  it 
at  once.  "I  have  left  the  party  for  a  moment.  I'm  getting  old 
and  all  this  noisy  talk  tires  me.  But  these  flowers  will  keep  me 
company.  They  have  their  own  way  of  talking  and  tell  the 
glory  of  God  better  than  men"  (or  some  such  stuff). 

The  worthy  man  has  no  conception  how  much  he  bores  his 
pupils  with  remarks  of  this  kind;  he  is  so  sincere  in  making 
them,  that  one  hasn't  the  heart  to  be  ironical.  Simple  souls  like 
his  are  certainly  the  ones  I  find  it  most  difficult  to  understand. 
If  one  is  a  little  less  simple  oneself,  one  is  forced  into  a  kind  of 
pretence;  not  very  honest,  but  what  is  one  to  do?  It  is  impos- 
sible either  to  argue  or  to  say  what  one  thinks;  one  can  only 
acquiesce.  If  one's  opinions  are  the  least  bit  different  from  his, 
Azais  forces  one  to  be  hypocritical.  When  I  first  used  to  fre- 
quent the  family,  the  way  in  which  his  grandchildren  lied  to 
him  made  me  indignant.  I  soon  found  myself  obliged  to  follow 
suit. 

Pastor  Prosper  Vedel  is  too  busy;  Madame  Vedel,  who  is 
rather  foolish,  lives  plunged  in  a  religio-poetico  day-dream,  in 
which  she  loses  all  sense  of  reality;  the  young  people's  moral 
bringing-up,  as  well  as  their  education,  has  been  taken  in  hand 
by  their  grandfather.  Once  a  month  at  the  time  when  I  lived 
with  them,  I  used  to  assist  at  a  stormy  scene  of  explanations, 
which  would  end  up  by  effusive  and  pathetic  appeals  of  this 
kind: 

"Henceforth  we  will  be  perfectly  frank  and  open  with  one 
another."  (He  likes  using  several  words  to  say  the  same  thing — 
an  odd  habit,  left  him  from  the  time  of  his  pastorship.)  "There 
shall  be  no  more  concealments,  we  won't  keep  anything  back  in 
the  future,  will  we?  Everything  is  to  be  above  board.  We  shall 


97  LAURA'S  WEDDING 

be  able  to  look  each  other  straight  in  the  face.  That's  a  bargain, 
isn't  it?" 

After  which  they  sank  deeper  than  ever  into  their  bog — he 
of  blindness — and  the  children  of  deceit. 

These  remarks  were  chiefly  addressed  to  a  brother  of  Laura's, 
a  year  younger  than  she;  the  sap  of  youth  was  working  in  him 
and  he  was  making  his  first  essays  of  love.  (He  went  out  to  the 
colonies  and  I  have  lost  sight  of  him.)  One  evening  when  the 
old  man  had  been  talking  in  this  way,  I  went  to  speak  to  him  in 
his  study;  I  tried  to  make  him  understand  that  the  sincerity 
which  he  demanded  from  his  grandson  was  made  impossible  by 
his  own  severity.  Azais  almost  lost  his  temper: 

"He  has  only  to  do  nothing  of  which  he  need  be  ashamed," 
he  exclaimed  in  a  tone  of  voice  which  allowed  of  no  re- 
ply. 

All  the  same  he  is  an  excellent  man — a  paragon  of  virtue, 
and  what  people  call  a  heart  of  gold;  but  his  judgments  are 
childish.  His  great  esteem  for  me  comes  from  the  fact  that,  as 
far  as  he  knows,  I  have  no  mistress.  He  did  not  conceal  from 
me  that  he  had  hoped  to  see  me  marry  Laura;  he  is  afraid 
Douviers  may  not  be  the  right  husband  for  her,  and  he  re- 
peated several  times:  "I  am  surprised  at  her  choice";  then  he 
added,  "Still  he  seems  to  me  an  excellent  fellow.  .  .  .  What  do 
you  think?  .  .  ." 

To  which  I  answered,  "Certainly." 

The  deeper  the  soul  plunges  into  religious  devotion,  the  more 
it  loses  all  sense  of  reality,  all  need,  all  desire,  all  love  for  reality. 
I  have  observed  the  same  thing  in  Vedel  upon  the  few  occasions 
that  I  have  spoken  to  him.  The  dazzling  light  of  their  faith 
blinds  them  to  the  surrounding  world  and  to  their  own  selves. 
As  for  me,  who  care  for  nothing  so  much  as  to  see  the  world 
and  myself  clearly,  I  am  amazed  at  the  coils  of  falsehood  in 
which  devout  persons  take  delight. 

I  tried  to  get  Aza'is  to  speak  of  Olivier,  but  he  takes  more 
interest  in  George. 

"Don't  let  him  see  that  you  know  what  I  am  going  to  tell 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  98 

you,"  he  began;  "for  that  matter,  it's  entirely  to  his  credit. 
Just  fancy!  your  nephew  with  a  few  of  his  schoolfellows  has 
started  a  kind  of  little  society — a  little  mutual  emulation 
league;  the  ones  who  are  allowed  into  it  must  show  themselves 
worthy  and  furnish  proofs  of  their  virtue — a  kind  of  children's 
Legion  of  Honour.  Isn't  it  charming?  They  all  wear  a  little 
ribbon  in  their  button  hole — not  very  noticeable,  certainly,  but 
all  the  same  1  noticed  it.  I  sent  for  the  boy  to  my  study  and 
when  I  asked  him  the  meaning  of  this  badge,  he  began  by  being 
very  much  embarrassed.  The  dear  little  chap  thought  I  was 
going  to  reprove  him.  Then  with  a  great  deal  of  confusion  and 
many  blushes,  he  told  me  about  the  starting  of  this  little  club. 
It's  the  kind  of  thing,  you  see,  one  must  be  very  careful  not  to 
smile  at;  one  might  hurt  all  sorts  of  delicate  feelings.  ...  I 
asked  him  why  he  and  his  friends  didn't  do  it  openly,  in  the 
light  of  day?  I  told  him  what  a  wonderful  power  of  propa- 
ganda, or  proselytism,  they  would  have,  what  fine  things  they 
might  do!  .  .  .  But  at  that  age,  one  likes  mysteries.  ...  To 
encourage  his  confidence,  I  told  him  that  in  my  time — that's  to 
say,  when  I  was  his  age — I  had  been  a  member  of  a  society  of 
the  same  kind,  and  that  we  went  by  the  grand  name  of  Knights 
of  Duty;  the  President  of  the  society  gave  us  each  a  note-book, 
in  which  we  set  down  with  absolute  frankness  our  failures  and 
our  shortcomings.  He  smiled  and  I  could  see  that  the  story  of 
the  note-books  had  given  him  an  idea;  I  didn't  insist,  but  I 
shouldn't  be  surprised  if  he  introduced  the  system  of  note-books 
among  his  companions.  You  see,  these  children  must  be  taken 
in  the  right  way;  and  in  the  first  place,  they  must  see  that  one 
understands  them.  I  promised  him  not  to  breathe  a  word  of  all 
this  to  his  parents;  though,  at  the  same  time,  I  advised  him  to 
tell  his  mother  all  about  it,  as  it  would  make  her  so  happy.  But 
it  seems  that  the  boys  had  given  their  word  of  honour  to  say 
nothing  about  it.  It  would  have  been  a  mistake  to  insist.  But 
before  he  left  me  we  joined  together  in  a  prayer  for  God  to 
bless  their  society." 

Poor,  dear  old  Azais!  I  am  convinced  the  little  rascal  was 
pulling  his  leg  and  that  there  wasn't  a  word  of  truth  in  the 


99  LAURA'S  WEDDING 

whole  thing.  But  what  else  could  he  have  said?  ...  I  must  try 
and  find  out  what  it's  all  about. 

I  did  not  at  first  recognize  Laura's  room.  It  has  been  re- 
papered;  its  whole  atmosphere  is  changed.  And  Sarah  too 
seemed  to  me  unrecognizable.  Yet  I  thought  I  knew  her.  She 
has  always  been  exceedingly  confidential  with  me.  All  her  life 
I  have  been  a  person  to  whom  one  could  say  anything.  But  I 
had  let  a  great  many  months  go  by  without  seeing  the  Vedels. 
Her  neck  and  arms  were  bare.  She  seemed  taller,  bolder.  She 
was  sitting  on  one  of  the  two  beds  beside  Olivier  and  right  up 
against  him;  he  was  lying  down  at  full  length  and  seemed  to  be 
asleep.  He  was  certainly  drunk;  and  as  certainly  I  suffered  at 
seeing  him  so,  but  I  thought  him  more  beautiful  than  ever.  In 
fact  they  were  all  four  of  them  more  or  less  drunk.  The  English 
girl  was  bursting  with  laughter  at  Armand's  ridiculous  re- 
marks— a  shrill  laughter  which  hurt  my  ears.  Armand  was  say- 
ing anything  that  came  into  his  head;  he  was  excited  and  flat- 
tered by  the  girl's  laughter  and  trying  to  be  as  stupid  and 
vulgar  as  she  was;  he  pretended  to  light  his  cigarette  at  the 
fire  of  his  sister's  and  Olivier's  flaming  cheeks,  and  to  burn  his 
fingers,  when  he  had  the  effrontery  to  seize  their  heads  and  pull 
them  together  by  force.  Olivier  and  Sarah  lent  themselves  to  his 
tomfoolery,  and  it  was  extremely  painful  to  me.  But  I  am 
anticipating.  .  .  . 

Olivier  was  still  pretending  to  be  asleep  when  Armand 
abruptly  asked  me  what  I  thought  of  Douviers.  I  had  sat  down 
in  a  low  arm-chair,  and  was  feeling  amused,  excited  and,  at 
the  same  time,  embarrassed  to  see  their  tipsiness  and  their  want 
of  restraint;  and  for  that  matter,  flattered  too,  that  they  had 
invited  me  to  join  them,  when  it  seemed  so  evident  that  it  was 
not  my  place  to  be  there. 

^The  young  ladies  here  present  .  .  ."  he  continued,  as  I 
found  nothing  to  answer  and  contented  myself  with  smiling 
blandly,  so  as  to  appear  up  to  the  mark.  Just  then,  the  English 
girl  tried  to  prevent  him  from  going  on  and  ran  after  him  to 
put  her  hand  over  his  mouth.  He  wriggled  away  from  her  and 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  100 

called  out:  "The  young  ladies  are  indignant  at  the  idea  of 
Laura's  going  to  bed  with  him." 

The  English  girl  let  go  of  him  and  exclaimed  in  pretended 
fury: 

"Oh,  you  mustn't  believe  what  he  says.  He's  a  liar!" 

"I  have  tried  to  make  them  understand,"  went  on  Armand, 
more  calmly,  "that  with  only  twenty  thousand  francs  for  a  dot, 
one  could  hardly  look  for  anything  better,  and  that,  as  a  true 
Christian,  she  ought  first  of  all  to  take  into  account  his  spiritual 
qualities,  as  our  father  the  pastor  would  say.  Yes,  my  children. 
And  then,  what  would  happen  to  the  population,  if  nobody  was 
allowed  to  marry  who  wasn't  an  Adonis  ...  or  an  Olivier, 
shall  we  say?  to  refer  to  a  more  recent  period?" 

"What  an  idiot!"  murmured  Sarah.  "Don't  listen  to  him.  He 
doesn't  know  what  he  is  saying." 

"I'm  saying  the  truth." 

I  had  never  heard  Armand  speak  in  this  way  before.  I 
thought  him — I  still  think  him — a  delicate,  sensitive  nature;  his 
vulgarity  seemed  to  me  entirely  put  on — due  in  part  to  his  be- 
ing drunk,  and  still  more  to  his  desire  to  amuse  the  English 
girl.  She  was  pretty  enough,  but  must  have  been  exceedingly 
silly  to  take  any  pleasure  in  such  fooling;  what  kind  of  in- 
terest could  Olivier  find  in  all  this?  ...  I  determined  not  to 
hide  my  disgust,  as  soon  as  we  should  be  alone. 

"But  you,"  went  on  Armand,  turning  suddenly  towards  me, 
"you,  who  don't  care  about  money  and  who  have  enough  to  in- 
dulge in  fine  sentiments,  will  you  consent  to  tell  us  why  you 
didn't  marry  Laura? — when  it  appears  you  were  in  love  with 
her,  and  when,  to  common  knowledge,  she  was  pining  away  for 
you?" 

Olivier,  who  up  to  that  moment  had  been  pretending  to  be 
asleep,  opened  his  eyes;  they  met  mine  and  if  I  did  not  blush, 
it  must  certainly  have  been  that  not  one  of  the  others  was  in  a 
fit  state  to  observe  me. 

"Armand,  you're  unbearable,"  said  Sarah,  as  though  to  put 
me  at  my  ease,  for  I  found  nothing  to  answer.  She  had  hitherto 
been  sitting  on  the  bed,  but  at  that  point  she  lay  down  at  full 


101  LAURA'S  WEDDING 

length  beside  Olivier,  so  that  their  two  heads  were  touch- 
ing. Upon  which,  Armand  leapt  up,  seized  a  large  screen  which 
was  standing  folded  against  the  wall,  and  with  the  antics  of  a 
clown  spread  it  out  so  as  to  hide  the  couple;  then,  still  clown- 
ing, he  leant  towards  me  and  said  without  lowering  his  voice: 

"Perhaps  you  didn't  know  that  my  sister  was  a  whore?" 

It  was  too  much.  1  got  up  and  pushed  the  screen  roughly 
aside.  Olivier  and  Sarah  immediately  sat  up.  Her  hair  had  come 
down.  Olivier  rose,  went  to  the  washhand  stand  and  bathed  his 
face. 

"Come  here,"  said  Sarah,  taking  me  by  the  arm,  "1  want  to 
show  you  something." 

She  opened  the  door  of  the  room  and  drew  me  out  on  to  the 
landing. 

"I  thought  it  might  be  interesting  to  a  novelist.  It's  a  note- 
book I  found  accidentally — Papa's  private  diary.  1  can't  think 
how  he  came  to  leave  it  lying  about.  Anybody  might  have  read 
it.  I  took  it  to  prevent  Armand  from  seeing  it.  Don't  tell  him 
about  it.  It's  not  very  long.  You  can  read  it  in  ten  minutes  and 
give  it  back  to  me  before  you  go." 

"But,  Sarah,"  said  1,  looking  at  her  fixedly,  "it's  most  fright- 
fully indiscreet." 

She  shrugged  her  shoulders.  "Oh,  if  that's  what  you  think, 
you'll  be  disappointed.  There's  only  one  place  in  which  it  gets 
interesting — and  even  that —  Look  here;  I'll  show  it  you." 

She  had  taken  out  of  her  bodice  a  very  small  memorandum 
book,  about  four  years  old.  She  turned  over  its  pages  for  a 
moment,  and  then  gave  it  to  me,  pointing  to  a  passage  as  she 
did  so. 

"Read  it  quickly." 

Under  the  date  and  in  quotation  marks,  I  first  of  all  saw  the 
Scripture  text:  "He  who  is  faithful  in  small  things  will  be 
faithful  also  in  great."  Then  followed:  "Why  do  I  always  put 
off  till  to-morrow  my  resolution  to  stop  smoking?  If  only  not  to 
grieve  Melanie"  (the  pastor's  wife).  "Oh,  Lord!  give  me 
strength  to  shake  off  the  yoke  of  this  shameful  slavery."  (I 
quote  it,  1  think  exactly.)  Then  came  notes  of  struggles,  be- 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  102 

seeching,  prayers,  efforts — which  were  evidently  all  in  vain,  as 
they  were  repeated  day  after  day.  Then  I  turned  another  page 
and  there  was  no  more  mention  of  the  subject. 

"Rather  touching,  isn't  it?"  asked  Sarah  with  the  faintest 
touch  of  irony,  when  I  had  done  reading. 

"It's  much  odder  than  you  think,"  I  couldn't  help  saying, 
though  I  reproached  myself  for  it.  "Just  think,  I  asked  your 
father  only  ten  days  ago  if  he  had  ever  tried  to  give  up  smok- 
ing. I  thought  I  was  smoking  a  good  deal  too  much  myself 
and  .  .  .  Anyway,  do  you  know  what  he  answered?  First  of  all 
he  said  that  the  evil  effects  of  tobacco  were  very  much  exag- 
gerated, and  that  as  far  as  he  was  concerned  he  had  never  felt 
any;  and  as  I  insisted:  'Yes,'  said  he,  at  last.  'I  have  made  up 
my  mind  once  or  twice  to  give  it  up  for  a  time.'  'And  did  you 
succeed?'  'Naturally,'  he  answered,  as  if  it  followed  as  a  matter 
of  course — 'since  I  made  up  my  mind  to.' — It's  extraordinary! 
Perhaps,  after  all,  he  didn't  remember,"  I  added,  not  wishing  to 
let  Sarah  see  the  depths  of  hypocrisy  I  suspected. 

"Or  perhaps,"  rejoined  Sarah,  "it  proves  that  'smoking'  stood 
for  something  else." 

Was  it  really  Sarah  who  spoke  in  this  way?  I  was  struck 
dumb.  I  looked  at  her,  hardly  daring  to  understand.  ...  At 
that  moment  Olivier  came  out  of  the  room.  He  had  combed  his 
hair,  arranged  his  collar  and  seemed  calmer. 

"Suppose  we  go,"  he  said,  paying  no  attention  to  Sarah,  "it's 
late." 

"I  am  afraid  you  may  mistake  me,"  he  said,  as  soon  as  we 
were  in  the  street.  "You  might  think  that  I'm  in  love  with 
Sarah.  But  I'm  not.  ...  Oh!  I  don't  detest  her  .  .  .  only  I 
don't  love  her." 

I  had  taken  his  arm  and  pressed  it  without  speaking. 

"You  mustn't  judge  Armand  either  from  what  he  said  to- 
day," he  went  on.  "It's  a  kind  of  part  he  acts  ...  in  spite  of 
himself.  In  reality  he's  not  in  the  least  like  that.  ...  I  can't 
explain.  He  has  a  kind  of  desire  to  spoil  everything  he  most 
cares  for.  He  hasn't  been  like  that  long.  I  think  he's  very  un- 
happy and  that  he  jokes  in  order  to  hide  it.  He's  very  proud.

Title  of  the  chapter:  THE  CELLULAR  SYSTEM. 

True,  there  exists  no  prison  (intellectual,  that  is)  from  which 
a  vigorous  mind  cannot  escape;  and  nothing  that  incites  to  re- 
bellion is  definitively  dangerous — although  rebellion  may  in 
certain  cases  distort  a  character — driving  it  in  upon  itself,  turn- 
ing it  to  contradiction  and  stubbornness,  and  impiously  prompt- 
ing it  to  deceit;  moreover  the  child  who  resists  the  influence  of 
his  family,  wears  out  the  first  freshness  of  his  energy  in  the  at- 
tempt to  free  himself.  But  also  the  education  which  thwarts  a 
child  strengthens  him  by  the  very  fact  of  hampering.  The 
most  lamentable  victims  of  all  are  the  victims  of  adulation. 
What  force  of  character  is  needed  to  detest  the  things  that  flat- 
ter us!  How  many  parents  I  have  seen  (the  mother  in  especial) 
who  delight  in  encouraging  their  children's  silliest  repugnances, 
their  most  unjust  prejudices,  their  failures  to  understand,  their 
unreasonable  antipathies.  ...  At  table:  "You'd  better  leave 
that;  can't  you  see,  it's  a  bit  of  fat?  Don't  eat  that  skin.  That's 
not  cooked  enough.  .  .  ."  Out  of  doors,  at  night:  "Oh,  a  bat! 
.  .  .  Cover  your  head  quickly;  it'll  get  into  your  hair."  Etc., 
etc.  .  .  .  According  to  them,  beetles  bite,  grasshoppers  sting, 
earthworms  give  spots  .  .  .  and  such-like  absurdities  in  every 
domain,  intellectual,  moral,  etc. 

In  the  suburban  train  the  day  before  yesterday,  as  I  was 
coming  back  from  Auteuil,  1  heard  a  young  mother  whispering 
to  a  little  girl  of  ten,  whom  she  was  petting: 

"You  and  me,  darling,  me  and  you — the  others  may  go 
hang!" 

(Oh,  yes!  I  knew  they  were  working  people,  but  the  people 
too  have  a  right  to  our  indignation.  The  husband  was  sitting  in 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  104 

the  corner  of  the  carriage  reading  the  paper — quiet,  resigned, 
not  even  a  cuckold,  I  dare  say.) 

Is  it  possible  to  conceive  a  more  insidious  poison? 

It  is  to  bastards  that  the  future  belongs.  How  full  of  meaning 
is  the  expression  "a  natural  child"!  The  bastard  alone  has  the 
right  to  be  natural. 

Family  egoism  .  .  .  hardly  less  hideous  than  personal  egoism. 

Nov.  6th. — I  have  never  been  able  to  invent  anything.  But 
I  set  myself  in  front  of  reality  like  a  painter,  who  should  say 
to  his  model:  "Take  up  such  and  such  an  attitude;  put  on  such 
and  such  an  expression."  I  can  make  the  models  which  society 
furnishes  me  act  as  I  please,  if  I  am  acquainted  with  their 
springs;  or  at  any  rate  I  can  put  such  and  such  problems  before 
them  to  solve  in  their  own  way,  so  that  I  learn  my  lesson  from 
their  reactions.  It  is  my  novelist's  instinct  that  is  constantly 
pricking  me  on  to  intervene — to  influence  the  course  of  their 
destiny.  If  I  had  more  imagination,  I  should  be  able  to  spin  in- 
vention intrigues;  as  it  is,  I  provoke  them,  observe  the  actors, 
and  then  work  at  their  dictation. 

Nov.  7th. — Nothing  that  I  wrote  yesterday  is  true.  Only  this 
remains — that  reality  interests  me  inasmuch  as  it  is  plastic, 
and  that  I  care  more — infinitely  more — for  what  may  be  than 
for  what  has  been.  I  lean  with  a  fearful  attraction  over  the 
depths  of  each  creature's  possibilities  and  weep  for  all  that  lies 
atrophied  under  the  heavy  lid  of  custom  and  morality. 

Here  Bernard  was  obliged  to  pause.  His  eyes  were  blurred. 
He  was  gasping  as  if  the  eagerness  with  which  he  read  had  made 
him  forget  to  breathe.  He  opened  the  window  and  filled  his  lungs 
before  taking  another  plunge.  His  friendship  for  Olivier  was 
no  doubt  very  great;  he  had  no  better  friend  and  there  was  no 
one  in  the  world  he  loved  so  much,  now  that  he  could  no  longer 
love  his  parents;  and  indeed  he  clung  to  this  affection  in  a 
manner  that  was  almost  excessive;  but  Olivier  and  he  did  not 


105  LAURA'S  WEDDING 

understand  friendship  quite  in  the  same  way.  Bernard,  as  he 
progressed  in  his  reading,  felt  with  more  and  more  astonish- 
ment and  admiration,  though  with  a  little  pain  too,  what  diver- 
sity this  friend  he  thought  he  knew  so  well,  was  capable  of 
showing.  Olivier  had  never  told  him  anything  of  what  the 
journal  recounted.  He  hardly  knew  of  the  existence  of  Armand 
and  Sarah.  How  different  Olivier  was  with  them  to  what  he 
was  with  him!  ...  In  that  room  of  Sarah's,  on  that  bed,  would 
Bernard  have  recognized  his  friend?  There  mingled  with  the  im- 
mense curiosity  which  drove  him  on  to  read  so  precipitately,  a 
queer  feeling  of  discomfort — disgust  or  pique.  He  had  felt  a 
little  of  this  pique  a  moment  before,  when  he  had  seen  Olivier 
on  Edouard's  arm — pique  at  being  out  of  it.  This  kind  of  pique 
may  lead  very  far  and  may  make  one  commit  all  sorts  of 
follies — like  every  kind  of  pique  for  that  matter. 

Well,  we  must  go  on.  All  this  that  I  have  been  saying  is  only 
to  put  a  little  air  between  the  pages  of  this  journal.  Now  that 
Bernard  has  got  his  breath  back  again,  we  will  return  to  it. 
He  dives  once  more  into  its  pages. 


EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:    FIRST  VISIT  TO 
LA   PEROUSE 

On  tire  pen  de  service  des  vieillards. 
Vauvenargues. 

Nov.  8th. — Old  Monsieur  and  Madame  de  la  Perouse  have 
changed  houses  again.  Their  new  apartment,  which  I  had 
never  seen  so  far,  is  an  entresol  in  the  part  of  the  Faubourg  St. 
Honore  which  makes  a  little  recess  before  it  cuts  across  the 
Boulevard  Haussmann.  I  rang  the  bell.  La  Perouse  opened  the 
door.  He  was  in  his  shirt  sleeves  and  was  wearing  a  sort  of 
yellowish  whitish  night-cap  on  his  head,  which  I  finally  made 
out  to  be  an  old  stocking  (Madame  de  La  Perouse's  no  doubt) 
tied  in  a  knot,  so  that  the  foot  dangled  on  his  cheek  like  a 
tassel.  He  was  holding  a  bent  poker  in  his  hand.  I  had  evi- 
dently caught  him  at  some  domestic  job,  and  as  he  seemed 
rather  confused: 

"Would  you  like  me  to  come  back  later?"  I  asked. 

"No,  no.  .  .  .  Come  in  here."  And  he  pushed  me  into  a  long, 
narrow  room  with  two  windows  looking  on  to  the  street,  just 
on  a  level  with  the  street  lamp.  "I  was  expecting  a  pupil  at  this 
very  moment"  (it  was  six  o'clock);  "but  she  has  telegraphed  to 
say  she  can't  come.  I  am  so  glad  to  see  you." 

He  laid  his  poker  down  on  a  small  table,  and,  as  though 
apologizing  for  his  appearance: 

"Madame  de  La  Perouse's  maid-servant  has  let  the  stove  go 
out.  She  only  comes  in  the  morning;  I've  been  obliged  to 
empty  it." 

"Shall  1  help  you  light  it?" 

"No,  no;  it's  dirty  work.  .  .  .  Will  you  excuse  me  while  1  go 
and  put  my  coat  on?" 


107  FIRST  VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

He  trotted  out  of  the  room  and  came  back  almost  immediately 
dressed  in  an  alpaca  coat,  with  its  buttons  torn  off,  its  elbows 
in  holes,  and  its  general  appearance  so  threadbare,  that  one 
wouldn't  have  dared  give  it  to  a  beggar.  We  sat  down. 

"You  think  I'm  changed,  don't  you?" 

I  wanted  to  protest,  but  could  hardly  find  anything  to  say,  I 
was  so  painfully  affected  by  the  harassed  expression  of  his  face, 
which  had  once  been  so  beautiful.  He  went  on: 

"Yes,  I've  grown  very  old  lately.  I'm  beginning  to  lose  my 
memory.  When  I  want  to  go  over  one  of  Bach's  fugues,  I  am 
obliged  to  refer  to  the  book.  .  .  ." 

"There  are  many  young  people  who  would  be  glad  to  have 
a  memory  like  yours." 

He  replied  with  a  shrug:  "Oh,  it's  not  only  my  memory 
that's  failing.  For  instance,  I  think  I  still  walk  pretty  quickly; 
but  all  the  same  everybody  in  the  street  passes  me." 

"Oh,"  said  I,  "people  walk  much  quicker  nowadays." 

"Yes,  don't  they?  ,  .  .  It's  the  same  with  my  lessons — my 
pupils  think  that  my  teaching  keeps  them  back;  they  want  to 
go  quicker  than  I  do.  I'm  losing  them.  .  .  .  Everyone's  in  a 
hurry  nowadays." 

He  added  in  a  whisper  so  low  that  I  could  hardly  hear  him: 
"I've  scarcely  any  left." 

I  felt  that  he  was  in  such  great  distress  that  I  didn't  dare 
question  him. 

"Madame  de  La  Perouse  won't  understand.  She  says  I  don't 
set  about  it  in  the  right  way — that  I  don't  do  anything  to  keep 
them  and  still  less  to  get  new  ones." 

"The  pupil  you  were  expecting  just  now  ..."  I  asked  awk- 
wardly. 

"Oh,  she!  I'm  preparing  her  for  the  Conservatoire.  She  comes 
here  to  practise  every  day." 

"Which  means  she  doesn't  pay  you." 

"Madame  de  La  Perouse  is  always  reproaching  me  with  it. 
She  can't  understand  that  those  are  the  only  lessons  that  inter- 
est me;  yes,  the  only  lessons  I  really  care  about  .  .  .  giving.  I 
have  taken  to  reflecting  a  great  deal  lately.  Here!  there's  some- 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  108 

thing  I  should  like  to  ask  you.  Why  is  it  there  is  so  little  about 
old  people  in  books?  ...  I  suppose  it's  because  old  people 
aren't  able  to  write  themselves  and  young  ones  don't  take  any 
interest  in  them.  No  one's  interested  in  an  old  man.  .  .  .  And 
yet  there  are  a  great  many  curious  things  that  might  be  said 
about  them.  For  instance:  there  are  certain  acts  in  my  past  life 
which  I'm  only  just  beginning  to  understand.  Yes,  I'm  just  be- 
ginning to  understand  that  they  haven't  at  all  the  meaning  I 
attached  to  them  in  the  old  days  when  I  did  them.  .  .  .  I've 
only  just  begun  to  understand  that  I  have  been  a  dupe  during 
the  whole  of  my  life.  Madame  de  La  Perouse  has  fooled  me; 
my  son  has  fooled  me;  everybody  has  fooled  me;  God  has 
fooled  me.  .  .  ." 

The  evening  was  closing  in.  I  could  hardly  make  out  my  old 
master's  features;  but  suddenly  the  light  of  the  street  lamp 
flashed  out  and  showed  me  his  cheeks  glittering  with  tears.  I 
looked  anxiously  at  first  at  an  odd  mark  on  his  temple,  like  a 
dint,  like  a  hole;  but  as  he  moved  a  little,  the  spot  changed 
places  and  I  saw  that  it  was  only  a  shadow  cast  by  a  knob  of 
the  balustrade.  I  put  my  hand  on  his  scraggy  arm;  he  shivered. 

"You'll  catch  cold,"  I  said.  "Really,  shan't  we  light  the 
fire?  .  .  .  Come  along." 

"No,  no;  one  must  harden  oneself." 

"What?  Stoicism?" 

"Yes,  a  little.  It's  because  my  throat  was  delicate  that  I  never 
would  wear  a  scarf.  I  have  always  struggled  with  myself." 

"That's  all  very  well  as  long  as  one  is  victorious;  but  if 
one's  body  gives  way  .  .  ." 

"That  would  be  the  real  victory." 

He  let  go  my  hand  and  went  on:  "1  was  afraid  you  would  go 
away  without  coming  to  see  me." 

"Go  where?"  I  asked. 

"I  don't  know.  You  travel  so  much.  There's  something  I 
wanted  to  say  to  you.  ...  I  expect  to  be  going  away  myself 
soon." 

"What!  are  you  thinking  of  travelling?"  I  asked  clumsily, 


109  FIRST  VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

pretending  not  to  understand  him,  notwithstanding  the  mys- 
terious solemnity  of  his  voice.  He  shook  his  head. 

"You  know  very  well  what  I  mean.  .  .  .  Yes,  yes.  I  know  it 
will  soon  be  time.  I  am  beginning  to  earn  less  than  my  keep; 
and  I  can't  endure  it.  There's  a  certain  point  beyond  which  I 
have  promised  myself  not  to  go." 

He  spoke  in  an  emotional  tone  which  alarmed  me. 

"Do  you  think  it  is  wrong?  I  have  never  been  able  to  under- 
stand why  it  was  forbidden  by  religion.  I  have  reflected  a  great 
deal  latterly.  When  I  was  young,  I  led  a  very  austere  life;  I 
used  to  congratulate  myself  on  my  force  of  character  every 
time  I  refused  a  solicitation  in  the  street.  I  didn't  understand, 
that  when  I  thought  I  was  freeing  myself,  in  reality  I  was  be- 
coming more  and  more  the  slave  of  my  own  pride.  Every  one 
of  these  triumphs  over  myself  was  another  turn  of  the  key  in 
the  door  of  my  prison.  That's  what  I  meant  just  now  by  saying 
that  God  had  fooled  me.  He  made  me  take  my  pride  for  virtue. 
He  was  laughing  at  me.  It  amuses  him.  I  think  he  plays  with 
us  as  a  cat  does  with  a  mouse.  He  sends  us  temptations  which 
he  knows  we  shan't  be  able  to  resist;  but  when  we  do  resist 
he  revenges  himself  still  worse.  Why  does  he  hate  us  so?  And 
why  .  .  .  But  I'm  boring  you  with  these  old  man's  questions." 

He  took  his  head  in  his  hands  like  a  moping  child  and  re- 
mained silent  so  long  that  I  began  to  wonder  whether  he  had 
not  forgotten  my  presence.  I  sat  motionless  in  front  of  him, 
afraid  of  disturbing  his  meditations.  Notwithstanding  the  noise 
of  the  street  which  was  so  close,  the  calm  of  the  little  room 
seemed  to  me  extraordinary,  and  notwithstanding  the  glimmer 
of  the  street  lamp,  which  shed  its  fantastic  light  upon  us  from 
down  below,  like  footlights  at  the  theatre,  the  shadow  on  each 
side  of  the  window  seemed  to  broaden,  and  the  darkness  round 
us  to  thicken,  as  in  icy  weather  the  water  of  a  quiet  pool  thick- 
ens into  immobility — till  my  heart  itself  thickened  into  ice  too. 
At  last,  shaking  myself  free  from  the  clutch  that  held  me,  I 
breathed  loudly  and,  preparatory  to  taking  my  leave,  I  asked 
out  of  politeness  and  in  order  to  break  the  spell : 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  110 

"How  is  Madame  de  La  Perouse?" 

The  old  man  seemed  to  wake  up  out  of  a  dream.  He  repeated : 

"Madame  de  La  Perouse  .  .  .  ?"  interrogatively,  as  if  the 
words  were  syllables  which  had  lost  all  meaning  for  him;  then 
he  suddenly  leant  towards  me: 

"Madame  de  La  Perouse  is  in  a  terrible  state  .  .  .  most 
painful  to  me." 

"What  kind  of  state?"  I  asked. 

"Oh,  no  kind."  he  said,  shrugging  his  shoulders,  as  if  there 
were  nothing  to  explain.  "She  is  completely  out  of  her  mind. 
She  doesn't  know  what  to  be  up  to  next." 

I  had  long  suspected  that  the  old  couple  were  in  profound 
disagreement,  but  without  any  hope  of  knowing  anything  more 
definite. 

"My  poor  friend,"  I  said  pityingly,  "and  since  when?" 

He  reflected  a  moment,  as  if  he  had  not  understood  my 
question. 

"Oh,  for  a  long  time  .  .  .  ever  since  I've  known  her."  Then, 
correcting  himself  almost  immediately:  "No;  in  reality  it  was 
over  my  son's  bringing  up  that  things  went  wrong." 

I  made  a  gesture  of  surprise,  for  I  had  always  thought  that 
the  La  Perouses  had  no  children.  He  raised  his  head,  which 
he  had  been  holding  in  his  hands,  and  went  on  more  calmly: 

"I  never  mentioned  my  son  to  you,  eh?  .  .  .  Well,  I'll  tell 
you  everything.  You  must  know  all  about  it  now.  There's 
no  one  else  I  can  tell.  .  .  .  Yes,  it  was  over  my  son's  bringing 
up.  As  you  see,  it's  a  long  time  ago.  The  first  years  of  our 
married  life  had  been  delightful.  I  was  very  pure  when  I 
married  Madame  de  La  Perouse.  I  loved  her  with  innocence 
.  .  .  yes,  that's  the  best  word  for  it,  and  I  refused  to  allow 
that  she  had  any  faults.  But  we  hadn't  the  same  ideas  about 
bringing  up  children.  Every  time  that  I  wanted  to  reprove  my 
son,  Madame  de  La  Perouse  took  his  side  against  me;  accord- 
ing to  her,  he  was  to  be  allowed  to  do  anything  he  liked.  They 
were  in  league  together  against  me.  She  taught  him  to  lie.  .  .  . 
When  he  was  barely  twenty  he  took  a  mistress.  She  was  a  pupil 
of  mine — a  Russian  girl,  with  a  great  talent  for  music,  to  whom 


Ill  FIRST  VISIT  TO  LA  PEROUSE 

I  was  very  much  attached.  Madame  de  La  Perouse  knew  all 
about  it;  but  of  course,  as  usual,  everything  was  kept  from 
me.  And  of  course  I  didn't  notice  she  was  going  to  have  a  baby. 
Not  a  thing — I  tell  you;  I  never  suspected  a  thing.  One  fine 
day,  I  am  informed  that  my  pupil  is  unwell,  that  she  won't 
be  able  to  come  for  some  time.  When  I  speak  about  go'ing 
to  see  her,  I  am  told  that  she  has  changed  her  address — that 
she  is  travelling.  ...  It  was  not  till  long  after  that  I  learnt 
that  she  had  gone  to  Poland  for  her  confinement.  My  son  joined 
her  there.  .  .  .  They  lived  together  for  several  years,  but  he 
died  before  marrying  her." 

"And  .  .  .  she?  did  you  ever  see  her  again?" 

He  seemed  to  be  butting  with  his  head  against  some  obstacle: 

"I  couldn't  forgive  her  for  deceiving  me.  Madame  de  La 
Perouse  still  corresponds  with  her.  When  I  learnt  she  was  in 
great  poverty,  I  sent  her  some  money  for  the  child's  sake.  But 
Madame  de  La  Perouse  knows  nothing  about  that.  No  more 
does  she  .  .  .  she  doesn't  know  the  money  came  from  me." 

"And  your  grandson?" 

A  strange  smile  flitted  over  his  face;  he  got  up. 

"Wait  a  moment.  I'll  show  you  his  photograph."  And  again 
he  trotted  quickly  out  of  the  room,  poking  his  head  out  in 
front  of  him.  When  he  came  back,  his  fingers  trembled  as  he 
looked  for  the  picture  in  a  large  letter-case.  He  held  it  towards 
me  and,  bending  forward,  whispered  in  a  low  voice: 

"I  took  it  from  Madame  de  La  Perouse  without  her  noticing. 
She  thinks  she  has  lost  it." 

"How  old  is  he?"  I  asked. 

"Thirteen.  He  looks  older,  doesn't  he?  He  is  very  delicate." 

His  eyes  filled  with  tears  once  more;  he  held  out  his  hand 
for  the  photograph,  as  if  he  were  anxious  to  get  it  back  again 
as  quickly  as  possible.  I  leant  forward  to  look  at  it  in  the  dim 
light  of  the  street  lamp;  I  thought  the  child  was  like  him;  I 
recognized  old  La  Perouse's  high,  prominent  forehead  and 
dreamy  eyes.  I  thought  I  should  please  him  by  saying  so;  he 
protested : 

"No,  no;  it's  my  brother  he's  like — a  brother  I  lost.  .  .  ." 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  112 

The  child  was  oddly  dressed  in  a  Russian  embroidered 
blouse. 

"Where  does  he  live?" 

"How  can  1  tell?"  cried  La  Perouse,  in  a  kind  of  despair. 
"They  keep  everything  from  me,  I  tell  you." 

He  had  taken  the  photograph,  and  after  having  looked  at 
it  a  moment,  he  put  it  back  in  the  letter-case,  which  he  slipped 
into  his  pocket. 

"When  his  mother  comes  to  Paris,  she  only  sees  Madame 
de  La  Perouse;  if  I  question  her,  she  always  answers:  'You  had 
better  ask  her  yourself.'  She  says  that,  but  at  heart  she  would 
hate  me  to  see  her.  She  has  always  been  jealous.  She  has 
always  tried  to  take  away  everything  I  care  for.  .  .  .  Little 
Boris  is  being  educated  in  Poland — at  Warsaw,  I  believe.  But 
he  often  travels  with  his  mother."  Then,  in  great  excitement: 
"Oh,  would  you  have  thought  it  possible  to  love  someone  one 
has  never  seen?  .  .  .  Well,  this  child  is  what  I  care  for  most 
in  the  world.  .  .  .  And  he  doesn't  know!" 

His  words  were  broken  by  great  sobs.  He  rose  from  his 
chair  and  threw  himself — fell  almost — into  my  arms.  I  would 
have  done  anything  to  give  him  some  comfort — but  what  could 
I  do?  I  got  up,  for  I  felt  his  poor  shrunken  form  slipping  to 
the  ground  and  I  thought  he  was  going  to  fall  on  his  knees. 
I  held  him  up,  embraced  him,  rocked  him  like  a  child.  He 
mastered  himself.  Madame  de  La  Perouse  was  calling  in  the 
next  room. 

"She's  coming.  .  .  .  You  don't  want  to  see  her,  do  you?  .  .  . 
Besides,  she's  stone  deaf.  Go  quickly."  And  as  he  saw  me  out 
on  to  the  landing: 

"Don't  be  too  long  without  coming  again."  (There  was  en- 
treaty in  his  voice.)  "Good-bye;  good-bye." 

hlov.  9th. — There  is  a  kind  of  tragedy,  it  seems  to  me,  which 
has  hitherto  almost  entirely  eluded  literature.  The  novel  has 
dealt  with  the  contrariness  of  fate,  good  or  evil  fortune,  social 
relationships,  the  conflicts  of  passions  and  of  characters — but 
not  with  the  very  essence  of  man's  being. 


113  FIRST  VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

And  yet,  the  whole  effect  of  Christianity  was  to  transfer  the 
drama  on  to  the  moral  plane.  But  properly  speaking  there  are 
no  Christian  novels.  There  are  novels  whose  purpose  is  edifi- 
cation; but  that  has  nothing  to  do  with  what  I  mean.  Moral 
tragedy — the  tragedy,  for  instance,  which  gives  such  terrific 
meaning  to  the  Gospel  text:  "If  the  salt  have  lost  his  flavour 
wherewith  shall  it  be  salted?" — that  is  the  tragedy  with  which 
I  am  concerned. 


Nov.  10th. — Olivier's  examination  is  coming  on  shortly.  Pau- 
line wants  him  to  try  for  the  Ecole  Normale  afterwards.  His 
career  is  all  mapped  out.  ...  If  only  he  had  no  parents,  no 
connections!  I  would  have  made  him  my  secretary.  But  the 
thought  of  me  never  occurs  to  him;  he  has  not  even  noticed 
my  interest  in  him,  and  I  should  embarrass  him  if  I  showed 
it.  It  is  because  I  don't  want  to  embarrass  him  that  I  affect 
a  kind  of  indifference  in  his  presence,  a  kind  of  detachment. 
It  is  only  when  he  does  not  see  me  that  I  dare  look  my  full 
at  him.  Sometimes  I  follow  him  in  the  street  without  his  know- 
ing it.  Yesterday  I  was  walking  behind  him  in  this  way,  when 
he  turned  suddenly  round  before  I  had  time  to  hide. 

"Where  are  you  off  to  in  such  a  hurry?"  I  asked  him. 

"Oh,  nowhere  particular.  I  always  seem  most  in  a  hurry  when 
I  have  nothing  to  do." 

We  took  a  few  steps  together,  but  without  finding  anything 
to  say  to  each  other.  He  was  certainly  put  out  at  having  been 
met. 


Nov.  12th. — He  has  parents,  an  elder  brother,  school  friends. 
...  I  keep  repeating  this  to  myself  all  day  long — and  that 
there  is  no  room  for  me.  I  should  no  doubt  be  able  to  make 
up  anything  that  might  be  lacking  to  him,  but  nothing  is. 
He  needs  nothing;  and  if  his  sweetness  delights  me,  there  is 
nothing  in  it  that  allows  me  for  a  moment  to  deceive  myself. 
.  .  .  Oh,  foolish  words,  which  I  write  in  spite  of  myself  and 
which  discover  the  duplicity  of  my  heart.  ...  I  am  leaving 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  114 

for  London  to-morrow.  I  have  suddenly  made  up  my  mind  to  go 
away.  It  is  time. 

To  go  away  because  one  is  too  anxious  to  stay!  ...  A 
certain  love  of  the  arduous — a  horror  of  indulgence  (towards 
oneself,  I  mean)  is  perhaps  the  part  of  my  Puritan  up-bringing 
which  I  find  it  hardest  to  free  myself  from. 

Yesterday,  at  Smith's,  bought  a  copy-book  (English  already) 
in  which  to  continue  my  diary.  I  will  write  nothing  more  in 
this  one.  A  new  copy-book!  .  .  . 

Ah!  if  it  were  myself  I  could  leave  behind!

BERNARD  AND   LAURA 

//  arrive  quelquefois  des  accidents  dans  la 
vie.  d'oU  il  faut  etre  un  peu  jou  pour  se  bien 
tirer. 

La  Rochefoucauld. 

It  was  with  Laura's  letter,  which  Edouard  had  inserted  into 
his  journal,  that  Bernard's  reading  came  to  an  end.  The  truth 
flashed  upon  him;  it  was  impossible  to  doubt  that  the  woman 
whose  words  rang  so  beseechingly  in  this  letter  was  the  same 
despairing  creature  of  whom  Olivier  had  told  him  the  night 
before — Vincent  Molinier's  discarded  mistress.  And  it  became 
suddenly  evident  to  Bernard  that,  thanks  to  this  two-fold  con- 
fidence, Olivier's,  and  Edouard's  in  his  journal,  he  was  as  yet 
the  only  one  to  know  the  two  sides  of  the  intrigue.  It  was  an 
advantage  he  could  not  keep  long;  he  must  play  his  cards 
quickly  and  skilfully.  He  made  up  his  mind  at  once.  Without 
forgetting,  for  that  matter,  any  of  the  other  things  he  had 
read,  Bernard  now  fixed  his  attention  upon  Laura. 

"This  morning  I  was  still  uncertain  as  to  what  I  ought  to 
do;  now  I  have  no  longer  any  doubt,"  he  said  to  himself,  as  he 
darted  out  of  the  room.  "The  imperative,  as  they  say,  is  cate- 
gorical. I  must  save  Laura.  It  was  not  perhaps  my  duty  to 
take  the  suit-case,  but  having  taken  it,  I  have  certainly  found 
in  the  suit-case  a  lively  sense  of  my  duty.  The  important  thing 
is  to  come  upon  Laura  before  Edouard  can  get  to  her;  to 
introduce  myself  and  offer  my  services  in  such  a  way  that  she 
cannot  take  me  for  a  swindler.  The  rest  will  be  easy.  At  this 
moment  I  have  enough  in  my  pocket-book  to  come  to  the 
rescue  of  misfortune  as  magnificently  as  the  most  generous 
and  the  most  compassionate  of  Edouards.  The  only  thing  which 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  116 

bothers  me  is  how  to  do  it.  For  Laura  is  a  Vedel,  and  though 
she  is  about  to  become  a  mother  in  defiance  of  the  code,  she 
is  no  doubt  a  sensitive  creature.  I  imagine  her  the  kind  of 
woman  who  stands  on  her  dignity  and  flings  her  contempt  in 
your  face,  as  she  tears  up  the  bank-notes  you  offer  her — with 
benevolence,  but  in  too  flimsy  an  envelope.  How  shall  I  pre- 
sent the  notes?  How  shall  I  present  myself?  That's  the  rub! 
As  soon  as  one  leaves  the  high  road  of  legality,  in  what  a 
tangle  one  finds  oneself!  I  really  am  rather  young  to  mix  my- 
self up  in  an  intrigue  as  stiff  as  this.  But,  hang  it  all,  youth's 
my  strong  point.  Let's  invent  a  candid  confession — a  touching 
and  interesting  story.  The  trouble  is  that  it's  got  to  do  for 
Edouard  as  well;  the  same  one — and  without  giving  myself 
away.  Oh!  I  shall  think  of  something.  Let's  trust  to  the  in- 
spiration of  the  moment.  .  .  ." 

He  had  reached  the  address  given  by  Laura,  in  the  Rue  de 
Beaune.  The  hotel  was  exceedingly  modest,  but  clean  and  re- 
spectable looking.  Following  the  porter's  directions,  he  went  up 
three  floors.  Outside  the  door  of  No.  16  he  stopped,  tried  to 
prepare  his  entry,  to  find  some  words;  he  could  think  of 
nothing;  then  he  made  a  dash  for  it  and  knocked.  A  gentle, 
sister-like  voice,  with,  he  thought,  a  touch  of  fear  in  it, 
answered : 

"Come  in!" 


Laura  was  very  simply  dressed,  all  in  black;  she  looked 
as  if  she  were  in  mourning.  During  the  few  days  she  had  been 
in  Paris,  she  had  been  vaguely  waiting  for  something  or  some- 
body to  get  her  out  of  her  straits.  She  had  taken  the  wrong 
road,  not  a  doubt  of  it;  she  felt  completely  lost.  She  had  the 
unfortunate  habit  of  counting  on  the  event  rather  than  on 
herself.  She  was  not  without  virtue,  but  now  that  she  had  been 
abandoned  she  felt  that  all  her  strength  had  left  her.  At  Ber- 
nard's entrance,  she  raised  one  hand  to  her  face,  like  someone 
who  keeps  back  a  cry  or  shades  his  eyes  from  too  bright  a  light. 
She  was  standing,  and  took  a  step  backwards;  then,  finding 


117  BERNARD  AND   LAURA 

herself  close  to  the  window,  with  her  other  hand  she  caught 
hold  of  the  curtain. 

Bernard  stopped,  waiting  for  her  to  question  him;  but  she 
too  waited  for  him  to  speak.  He  looked  at  her;  with  a  beating 
heart,  he  tried  in  vain  to  smile. 

"Excuse  me,  Madame,"  he  said  at  last,  "for  disturbing  you 
in  this  manner.  Edouard  X.,  whom  1  believe  you  know,  arrived 
in  Paris  this  morning.  I  have  something  urgent  to  say  to  him; 
I  thought  you  might  be  able  to  give  me  his  address  and  .  .  . 
forgive  me  for  coming  so  unceremoniously  to  ask  for  it." 

Had  Bernard  not  been  so  young,  Laura  would  doubtless 
have  been  frightened.  But  he  was  still  a  child,  with  eyes  so 
frank,  so  clear  a  brow,  so  timid  a  bearing,  a  voice  so  ill-assured, 
that  fear  yielded  to  curiosity,  to  interest,  to  that  irresistible 
sympathy  which  a  simple  and  beautiful  being  always  arouses. 
Bernard's  voice  gathered  a  little  courage  as  he  spoke. 

"But  I  don't  know  his  address,"  said  Laura.  "If  he  is  in  Paris, 
he  will  come  to  see  me  without  delay,  I  hope.  Tell  me  who 
you  are.  I  will  tell  him." 

"Now's  the  moment  to  risk  everything,"  thought  Bernard. 
Something  wild  flashed  across  his  eyes.  He  looked  Laura  steadily 
in  the  face. 

"Who  I  am?  .  .  .  Olivier  Molinier's  friend.  .  .  ."  He  hes- 
itated, still  uncertain;  but  seeing  her  turn  pale  at  this  name, 
he  ventured  further:  "Olivier,  Vincent's  brother — the  brother 
of  your  lover,  who  has  so  vilely  abandoned  you.  .  .  ." 

He  had  to  stop.  Laura  was  tottering.  Her  two  hands,  flung 
backwards,  were  anxiously  searching  for  some  support.  But 
what  upset  Bernard  more  than  anything  was  the  moan  she 
gave — a  kind  of  wail  which  was  scarcely  human,  more  like 
that  of  some  hunted,  wounded  animal  (and  the  sportsman, 
suddenly  filled  with  shame,  feels  himself  an  executioner) ;  so 
odd  a  cry  it  was,  so  different  from  anything  that  Bernard  ex- 
pected, that  he  shuddered.  He  understood  all  of  a  sudden  that 
this  was  a  matter  of  real  life,  of  veritable  pain,  and  every- 
thing he  had  felt  up  till  that  moment  seemed  to  him  mere 
show   and  pretence.   An  emotion  surged   up   in   him   so  un- 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  118 

familiar  that  he  was  unable  to  master  it.  It  rose  to  his  throat. 
.  .  .  What!  is  he  sobbing?  Is  it  possible?  ...  He,  Bernard! 
...  He  rushes  forward  to  hold  her  up,  and  kneels  before 
her,  and  murmurs  through  his  sobs: 

"Oh,  forgive  me  .  .  .  forgive;  I  have  hurt  you.  ...  I  knew 
that  you  were  in  difficulties,  and  ...  I  wanted  to  help  you." 

But  Laura,  gasping  for  breath,  felt  that  she  was  fainting. 
She  cast  round  with  her  eyes  for  somewhere  to  sit  down. 
Bernard,  whose  gaze  was  fixed  upon  her,  understood  her  look. 
He  sprang  towards  a  small  arm-chair  at  the  foot  of  the  bed, 
with  a  rapid  movement  pushed  it  towards  her,  and  she  dropped 
heavily  into  it. 

At  this  moment  there  occurred  a  grotesque  incident  which 
I  hesitate  to  relate,  but  it  was  decisive  of  Laura's  and  Bernard's 
relationship,  by  unexpectedly  relieving  them  of  their  embar- 
rassment. I  shall  therefore  not  attempt  to  embellish  the  scene 
by  any  artifices. 

For  the  price  which  Laura  paid  for  her  room  (I  mean, 
which  the  hotel-keeper  asked  her)  one  could  not  have  ex- 
pected the  furniture  to  be  elegant,  but  one  might  have  hoped 
it  would  be  solid.  Now  the  small  arm-chair,  which  Bernard 
pushed  towards  Laura,  was  somewhat  unsteady  on  its  feet; 
that  is  to  say,  it  had  a  great  propensity  to  fold  back  one  of  its 
legs,  as  a  bird  does  under  its  wing — which  is  natural  enough 
in  a  bird,  but  unusual  and  regrettable  in  an  arm-chair;  this 
one,  moreover,  hid  its  infirmity  as  best  it  could  beneath  a 
thick  fringe.  Laura  was  well  acquainted  with  her  arm-chair, 
and  knew  that  it  must  be  handled  with  extreme  precaution; 
but  in  her  agitation  she  forgot  this  and  only  remembered  it 
when  she  felt  the  chair  giving  way  beneath  her.  She  suddenly 
gave  a  little  cry — quite  different  from  the  long  moan  she  had 
uttered  just  before,  slipped  to  one  side,  and  a  moment  later 
found  herself  sitting  on  the  floor,  between  the  arms  of  Bernard, 
who  had  hurried  to  the  rescue.  Bashful,  but  amused,  he  had 
been  obliged  to  put  one  knee  on  the  ground.  Laura's  face 
therefore  happened  to  be  quite  close  to  his;  he  watched  her 
blush.  She  made  an  effort  to  get  up;  he  helped  her. 


119  BERNARD  AND   LAURA 

"You've  not  hurt  yourself?" 

"No;  thanks  to  you.  This  arm-chair  is  ridiculous;  it  has 
been  mended  once  already.  ...  I  think  if  the  leg  is  put  quite 
straight,  it  will  hold." 

"I'll  arrange  it,"  said  Bernard.  "There!  .  .  .  Will  you  try 
it?"  Then,  thinking  better  of  it:  "No;  allow  me.  It  would  be 
safer  for  me  to  try  it  first.  Look!  It's  all  right  now.  I  can  move 
my  legs"  (which  he  did,  laughing).  Then,  as  he  rose:  "Sit  down 
now,  and  if  you'll  allow  me  to  stay  a  moment  or  two  longer, 
I'll  take  this  chair.  I'll  sit  near  you,  so  that  I  shall  be  able 
to  prevent  you  from  falling.  Don't  be  frightened.  ...  I  wish 
I  could  do  more  for  you." 

There  was  so  much  ardour  in  his  voice,  so  much  reserve  in 
his  manners,  and  in  his  movements  so  much  grace,  that  Laura 
could  not  forbear  a  smile. 

"You  haven't  told  me  your  name  yet." 

"Bernard." 

"Yes.  But  your  family  name?" 

"I  have  no  family." 

"Well,  your  parents'  name." 

"I  have  no  parents.  That  is,  I  am  what  the  child  you  are 
expecting  will  be — a  bastard." 

The  smile  vanished  from  Laura's  face;  she  was  outraged  by 
this  insistent  determination  to  force  an  entrance  into  her  in- 
timacy and  to  violate  the  secret  of  her  life. 

"But  how  do  you  know?  .  .  .  Who  told  you?  .  .  .  You  have 
no  right  to  know.  .  .  ." 

Bernard  was  launched  now;  he  spoke  loudly  and  boldly: 

"I  know  both  what  my  friend  Olivier  knows  and  what  your 
friend  Edouard  knows.  Only  each  of  them  as  yet  knows  only 
half  your  secret.  I  am  probably  the  only  person  besides  your- 
self to  know  the  whole  of  it.  .  .  .  So  you  see,"  he  added  more 
gently,  "it's  essential  that  I  should  be  your  friend." 

"Oh,  how  can  people  be  so  indiscreet?"  murmured  Laura 
sadly.  "But  ...  if  you  haven't  seen  Edouard,  he  can't  have 
spoken  to  you.  Has  he  written  to  you?  ...  Is  it  he  who  has 
sent  you?"  .  .  . 

Bernard  had  given  himself  away;  he  had  spoken  too  quickly 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  120 

and  had  not  been  able  to  resist  bragging  a  little.  He  shook  his 
head.  Laura's  face  grew  still  darker.  At  that  moment  a  knock 
was  heard  at  the  door. 

Whether  they  will  or  no,  a  link  is  created  between  two 
creatures  who  experience  a  common  emotion.  Bernard  felt  him- 
self trapped;  Laura  was  vexed  at  being  surprised  in  company. 
They  looked  at  each  other  like  two  accomplices.  Another  knock 
was  heard.  Both  together  said: 

"Come  in." 

For  some  minutes  Edouard  had  been  listening  outside  the 
door,  astonished  at  hearing  voices  in  Laura's  room.  Bernard's 
last  sentences  had  explained  everything.  He  could  not  doubt 
their  meaning;  he  could  not  doubt  that  the  speaker  was  the 
stealer  of  his  suit-case.  His  mind  was  immediately  made  up. 
For  Edouard  is  one  of  those  beings  whose  faculties,  which 
seem  benumbed  in  the  ordinary  routine  of  daily  life,  spring 
into  activity  at  the  call  of  the  unexpected.  He  opened  the  door 
therefore,  but  remained  on  the  threshold,  smiling  and  looking 
alternately  at  Laura  and  Bernard,  who  had  both  risen. 

"Allow  me,  my  dear  Laura,"  said  he,  with  a  gesture  as  though 
to  put  off  any  effusions  till  later.  "I  must  first  say  a  word  or 
two  to  this  gentleman,  if  he  will  be  so  good  as  to  step  into 
the  passage  for  a  moment." 

His  smile  became  more  ironical  when  Bernard  joined  him. 

"I  thought  I  should  find  you  here." 

Bernard  understood  that  the  game  was  up.  There  was  nothing 
for  him  to  do  but  to  put  a  bold  face  on  it,  which  he  did  with 
the  feeling  that  he  was  playing  his  last  card: 

"I  hoped  I  should  meet  you." 

"In  the  first  place — if  you  haven't  done  so  already  (for 
I'll  do  you  the  credit  of  believing  that  that  is  what  you  came 
for),  you  will  go  downstairs  to  the  bureau  and  settle  Madame 
Douviers'  bill  with  the  money  you  found  in  my  suit-case  and 
which  you  must  have  on  you.  Don't  come  up  again  for  ten 
minutes." 

All  this  jvas  said  gravely  but  with  nothing  comminatory  in 


121  BERNARD  AND   LAURA 

the  tone.  In  the  mean  time  Bernard  had  recovered  his  self- 
possession. 

"I  did  in  fact  come  for  that.  You  are  not  wrong.  And  I  am 
beginning  to  think  that  /  was  not  wrong  either." 

"What  do  you  mean  by  that?" 

"That  you  really  are  the  person   I   hoped  you  would  be." 

Edouard  was  trying  in  vain  to  look  severe.  He  was  im- 
mensely entertained.  He  made  a  kind  of  slight  mocking  bow: 

"Much  obliged.  It  remains  to  be  seen  whether  I  shall  be 
able  to  return  the  compliment.  I  suppose,  since  you  are  here, 
that  you  have  read  my  papers?" 

Bernard,  who  had  endured  without  flinching  the  brunt  of 
Edouard's  gaze,  smiled  in  his  turn  with  boldness,  amusement, 
impertinence;  and  bowing  low,  "Don't  doubt  it,"  he  said.  "I 
am  here  to  serve  you." 

Then,  quick  as  an  elf,  he  darted  downstairs. 

When  Edouard  went  back  into  the  room,  Laura  was  sobbing. 
He  went  up  to  her.  She  put  her  forehead  down  on  his  shoulder. 
Any  manifestation  of  emotion  embarrassed  him  almost  un- 
bearably. He  found  himself  gently  patting  her  on  the  back 
as  one  does  a  choking  child: 

"My  poor  Laura,"  said  he;  "come,  come,  be  sensible." 

"Oh,  let  me  cry  a  little;  it  does  me  good." 

"All  the  same  we've  got  to  consider  what  you  are  to  do." 

"What  is  there  I  can  do?  Where  can  I  go?  To  whom  can  I 
speak?" 

"Your  parents.  .  .  ," 

"You  know  what  they  are.  It  would  plunge  them  in  despair. 
And  they  did  everything  they  could  to  make  me  happy." 

"Douviers?  .  .  ." 

"I  shall  never  dare  face  him  again.  He  is  so  good.  You 
mustn't  think  I  don't  love  him.  ...  If  you  only  knew  .  .  . 
If  you  only  knew  .  .  .  Oh,  say  you  don't  despise  me  too  much." 

"On  the  contrary,  my  dear;  on  the  contrary.  How  can  you 
imagine  such  a  thing?"  And  he  began  patting  her  on  the  back 
again. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  122 

"Yes;  I  don't  feel  ashamed  any  more,  when  I  am  with  you." 

"How  long  have  you  been  here?" 

"I  can't  remember.  I  have  only  been  living  in  the  hopes  that 
you  would  come.  There  were  times  when  1  thought  I  couldn't 
bear  it.  I  feel  now  as  if  I  couldn't  stay  here  another  day." 

Her  sobs  redoubled  and  she  almost  screamed  out,  though  in 
a  choking  voice: 

"Take  me  away!  Take  me  away!" 

Edouard  felt  more  and  more  uncomfortable. 

"Now  Laura  .  .  .  You  must  be  calm.  That  .  .  .  that  .  .  . 
I  don't  even  know  his  name.  .  .  ." 

"Bernard,"  murmured  Laura. 

"Bernard  will  be  back  in  a  moment.  Come  now;  pull  your- 
self together.  He  mustn't  see  you  in  this  state.  Courage!  We'll 
think  of  something,  I  promise  you.  Come,  come!  Dry  your  eyes. 
Crying  does  no  good.  Look  at  yourself  in  the  glass.  Your  face 
is  all  swollen.  You  must  bathe  it.  When  I  see  you  crying  I 
can't  think  of  anything.  .  .  .  There!  Here  he  is!  I  can  hear 
him." 

He  went  to  the  door  and  opened  it  to  let  in  Bernard,  while 
Laura,  with  her  back  turned  at  the  dressing-table,  set  about 
restoring  a  semblance  of  calm  to  her  features. 

"And  now,  sir,  may  I  ask  when  I  shall  be  allowed  to  get 
possession  of  my  belongings  again?" 

He  looked  Bernard  full  in  the  face  as  he  spoke,  with  the 
same  ironical  smile  on  his  lips  as  before. 

"As  soon  as  you  please,  sir;  but  at  the  same  time,  I  feel 
obliged  to  confess  that  I  shall  certainly  feel  the  loss  of  your 
belongings  a  good  deal  more  than  you  do.  I  am  sure  you 
would  understand  if  you  only  knew  my  story.  But  I'll  just 
say  this,  that  since  this  morning  I  am  without  a  roof,  without 
a  family  and  with  nothing  better  to  do  than  throw  myself 
into  the  river,  if  I  hadn't  met  you.  I  followed  you  this  morn- 
ing for  a  long  time  while  you  were  talking  to  my  friend  Olivier. 
He  has  spoken  to  me  about  you  such  a  lot!  I  should  have 
liked  to  go  up  to  you.  I  was  casting  about  for  some  excuse 
to  do  so,  by  hook  or  by  crook.  .  .  .  When  you  threw  your 


123  BERNARD  AND  LAURA 

luggage  ticket  away,  I  blessed  my  stars.  Oh,  don't  take  me 
for  a  thief.  If  I  lifted  your  suit-case,  it  was  more  than  any- 
thing so  as  to  get  into  touch  with  you." 

Bernard  brought  all  this  out  almost  in  a  single  breath.  An 
extraordinary  animation  fired  his  words  and  features— as  though 
they  were  aflame  with  kindness.  Edouard,  to  judge  by  his 
smile,  thought  him  charming. 

"And  now  .  .  .  ?"  asked  he. 

Bernard  understood  that  he  was  gaining  ground. 

"And  now,  weren't  you  in  need  of  a  secretary?  I  can't  believe 
I  should  fill  the  post  badly— it  would  be  with  such  joy." 

This  time  Edouard  laughed  outright.  Laura  watched  them 
both  with  amusement. 

"Ho!  Ho!  .  .  .  We  must  think  about  that.  Come  and  see 
me  to-morrow  at  the  same  time,  and  here — if  Madame  Dou- 
viers  will  allow  it — for  I  have  a  great  many  things  to  settle 
with  her  too.  You're  staying  at  a  hotel,  I  suppose?  Oh,  I  don't 
want  to  know  where.  It  doesn't  matter  in  the  least.  Till  to- 
morrow." 

He  held  out  his  hand. 

"Sir,  before  I  leave  you,"  said  Bernard,  "will  you  allow  me 
to  remind  you  that  there  is  a  poor  old  music-master,  called  La 
Perouse,  I  think,  who  is  living  in  the  Faubourg  St.  Honore, 
and  who  would  be  made  very  happy  by  a  visit  from  you?" 

"Upon  my  word,  that's  not  a  bad  beginning.  You  have  a 
very  fair  notion  of  your  future  duties." 

"Then  .  .  .  Really?  You  consent?" 

"We'll  see  about  it  to-morrow.  Good-bye." 

Edouard,  after  having  stayed  a  few  moments  longer  with 
Laura,  went  to  the  Moliniers'.  He  hoped  to  see  Olivier  again; 
he  wanted  to  speak  to  him  about  Bernard.  He  saw  only 
Pauline,  though  he  stayed  on  and  on  in  desperation. 

Olivier,  that  very  afternoon,  yielding  to  the  pressing  invi- 
tation passed  on  to  him  by  his  brother,  had  gone  to  visit  the 
author  of  The  Horizontal  Bar,  the  Comte  de  Passavant. 


XV 

OLIVIER  VISITS  THE  COMTE   DE 
PASSAVANT 

"I  WAS  afraid  your  brother  hadn't  delivered  my  message,"  said 
Robert  on  seeing  Olivier  come  into  the  room. 

"Am  I  late?"  he  asked,  coming  fcward  timidly  and  almost 
on  tip-toe.  He  had  kept  his  hat  in  his  hand  and  Robert  took 
it  from  him. 

"Put  that  down.  Make  yourself  comfortable.  Here,  in  this 
arm-chair,  I  think  you'll  be  all  right.  Not  late  at  all,  to  judge 
by  the  clock.  But  my  wish  to  see  you  went  faster  than  the 
time.  Do  you  smoke?" 

"No,  thank  you,"  said  Olivier,  waving  aside  the  cigarette 
case,  which  the  Comte  de  Passavant  held  out  to  him.  He  re- 
fused out  of  shyness,  though  he  was  really  longing  to  try  one 
of  the  slender,  amber-scented  cigarettes  (Russian,  no  doubt,) 
which  lay  ranged  in  the  proffered  case. 

"Yes,  I'm  glad  you  were  able  to  come.  I  was  afraid  you  might 
be  too  much  taken  up  with  your  examination.  When  is  it?" 

"The  written  is  in  ten  days.  But  I'm  not  working  much. 
I  think  I'm  ready  and  I'm  more  afraid  of  being  fagged  when 
I  go  up." 

"Still,  I  suppose  you'd  refuse  to  undertake  any  other  oc- 
cupation just  now?" 

"No  ...  if  it  isn't  too  absorbing,  that  is." 

"I'll  tell  you  why  I  asked  you  to  come.  First,  for  the  pleasure 
of  seeing  you  again.  The  other  night  in  the  foyer,  during  the 
entr'acte,  we  were  just  getting  into  a  talk.  I  was  exceedingly 
interested  by  what  you  said.   I  expect  you  don't  remember?" 

"Oh  yes,  I  do,"  said  Olivier,  who  was  under  the  impression 
he  had  said  nothing  but  stupidities. 


125  OLIVIER  VISITS   PASSAVANT 

"But  to-day  I  have  something  special  to  say  to  you.  ...  I 
think  you  know  an  individual  of  the  Hebrew  persuasion,  called 
Dhurmer?  Isn't  he  one  of  your  schoolfellows?" 

"I  have  just  this  moment  left  him." 

"Ah!  You  see  a  good  deal  of  each  other?" 

"Yes.  We  met  at  the  Louvre  to-day  to  talk  about  a  review 
of  which  he  is  to  be  the  editor." 

Robert  burst  into  a  loud,  affected  laugh. 

"Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  the  editor!  .  .  .  He's  in  a  deuce  of  a  hurry. 
.  .  .  Did  he  really  say  that  to  you?" 

"He  has  been  talking  to  me  about  it  for  ever  so  long." 

"Yes.  I  have  been  thinking  of  it  for  some  time  past.  The 
other  day  I  asked  him  casually  whether  he'd  agree  to  read 
over  the  manuscripts  with  me;  that's  what  he  at  once  called 
becoming  editor — not  even  sub-editor;  I  didn't  contradict  him 
and  he  immediately  .  .  .  Just  like  him,  isn't  it?  What  a 
fellow!  He  wants  taking  down  a  peg  or  two.  .  .  .  Don't  you 
really  smoke?" 

"After  all,  I  think  I  will,"  said  Olivier,  this  time  accepting. 
"Thank  you." 

"Well,  allow  me  to  say,  Olivier  .  .  .  you  don't  mind  my 
calling  you  Olivier,  do  you?  I  really  can't  say  Monsieur; 
you're  too  young,  and  I'm  too  intimate  with  your  brother 
Vincent  to  call  you  Molinier.  Well  then,  Olivier,  allow  me  to 
say  that  I  have  infinitely  more  confidence  in  your  taste  than 
in  Mr.  Solomon  Dhurmer's.  Now  would  you  consent  to  taking 
the  literary  direction?  Under  me  a  little,  of  course — at  first, 
at  any  rate.  But  I  prefer  not  to  have  my  name  on  the  cover. 
I'll  tell  you  why  later.  .  .  .  Perhaps  you'd  take  a  glass  of  port 
wine,  eh?  I've  got  some  that's  quite  good." 

He  stretched  out  his  hand  to  a  kind  of  little  side-board  that 
stood  near  and  took  up  a  bottle  of  wine  and  two  glasses,  which 
he  filled. 

"Well!  What  do  you  think?" 

"Yes,  indeed;  first-rate." 

"I  wasn't  talking  of  the  port,"  protested  Robert,  laughing; 
"but  of  what  I  was  saying  just  now." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  126 

Olivier  had  pretended  not  to  understand.  He  was  afraid  of 
accepting  too  quickly  and  of  showing  his  joy  too  obviously. 
He  blushed  a  little  and  stammered  with  confusion: 

"My  examination  wouldn't  .  .  ." 

"You  have  just  told  me  that  you  weren't  giving  much  time  to 
it,"  interrupted  Robert.  "And  besides,  the  review  won't  come 
out  yet  awhile.  I  am  wondering  whether  it  wouldn't  be  better 
to  put  off  launching  it  till  after  the  holidays.  But  in  any  case 
I  had  to  sound  you.  We  must  get  several  numbers  ready 
before  October  and  we  ought  to  see  each  other  a  great  deal 
this  summer  so  as  to  talk  things  over.  What  are  you  going 
to  do  these  holidays?" 

"I  don't  know  exactly.  My  people  will  probably  be  going 
to  Normandy.  They  always  do  in  the  summer." 

"And  you  will  have  to  go  with  them?  .  .  .  Couldn't  you 
let  yourself  be  unhitched  for  a  bit?  .  .  ." 

"My  mother  would  never  consent." 

"I'm  dining  to-night  with  your  brother.  May  I  speak  to  him 
about  it?" 

"Oh,  Vincent  won't  be  with  us."  Then,  realizing  that  this 
sentence  was  no  answer  to  the  question,  he  added:  "Besides,  it 
wouldn't  do  any  good." 

"Well,  but  if  we  find  a  good  reason  to  give  Mamma?" 

Olivier  did  not  answer.  He  loved  his  mother  tenderly  and 
the  mocking  tone  in  which  Robert  alluded  to  her  displeased 
him.  Robert  understood  that  he  had  gone  too  far. 

"So  you  appreciate  my  port,"  he  said  by  way  of  diversion. 
"Have  another  glass?" 

"No,  no,  thank  you;  but  it's  excellent." 

"Yes,  I  was  struck  by  the  ripeness  and  sureness  of  your 
judgment  the  other  night.  Do  you  mean  to  go  in  for  criticism?" 

"No." 

"Poetry?  ...  I  know  you  write  poetry." 

Olivier  blushed  again. 

"Yes,  your  brother  has  betrayed  you.  And  no  doubt  you 
know  other  young  men  who  would  be  ready  to  contribute. 


127  OLIVIER   VISITS   PASSAVANT 

This  review  must  become  a  rallying  ground  for  the  younger 
generation.  That's  its  raison  d'etre.  I  should  like  you  to  help 
me  draw  up  a  kind  of  prospectus,  a  manifesto,  which  would 
just  give  a  sketch  of  the  new  tendencies  without  defining  them 
too  precisely.  We'll  talk  it  over  later  on.  We  must  make  a 
choice  of  two  or  three  telling  epithets;  they  mustn't  be  neo- 
logisms; no  old  words  that  are  thoroughly  hackneyed;  we'll  fill 
them  with  a  brand  new  meaning  and  make  the  public  swallow 
them.  After  Flaubert  there  was  'cadenced  and  rhythmic';  after 
Leconte  de  Lisle,  'hieratic  and  definitive'  ...  Oh !  what  would 
you  say  to  'vital,'  eh?  .  .  ,  'Unconscious  and  vital'  .  .  .  No? 
.  .  .  'Elementary,  unconscious  and  vital'?" 

"I  think  we  might  find  something  better  still,"  Olivier  took 
courage  to  say,  smiling,  though  without  seeming  to  approve 
much. 

"Come,  another  glass  of  port.  .  .  ." 

"Not  quite  full,  please." 

"You  see,  the  great  weakness  of  the  symbolist  school  is  that 
it  brought  nothing  but  an  aesthetic  with  it;  all  the  other  great 
schools  brought  with  them,  besides  their  new  styles,  a  new 
ethic,  new  tables,  a  new  way  of  looking  at  things,  of  under- 
standing love,  of  behaving  oneself  in  life.  As  for  the  symbolist, 
it's  perfectly  simple;  he  didn't  behave  himself  at  all  in  life; 
he  didn't  attempt  to  understand  it;  he  denied  its  existence;  he 
turned  his  back  on  it.  Absurd,  don't  you  think?  They  were  a 
set  of  people  without  greed — without  appetites  even.  Not  like 
us  .  .  .  eh?" 

Olivier  had  finished  his  second  glass  of  port  and  his  second 
cigarette.  Reclining  in  his  comfortable  arm-chair,  with  his 
eyes  half  shut,  he  said  nothing,  but  signified  his  assent  by 
slightly  nodding  his  head  from  time  to  time.  At  this  moment 
a  ring  was  heard,  and  almost  immediately  afterwards  a  servant 
entered  with  a  card  which  he  presented  to  Robert.  Robert  took 
the  card,  glanced  at  it  and  put  it  on  his  writing  desk  beside  him. 

"Very  well.  Ask  him  to  wait  a  moment."  The  servant  went 
out.  "Look  here,  my  dear  boy,  I  like  you  very  much  and  I 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  128 

think  we  shall  get  on  very  well  together.  But  somebody  has  just 
come  whom  I  absolutely  must  see  and  he  wants  to  speak  to 
me  alone." 

Olivier  had  risen. 

"I'll  show  you  out  by  the  garden,  if  you'll  allow  me.  .  .  . 
Ah!  whilst  1  think  of  it.  Would  you  care  to  have  my  new 
book?  I've  got  a  copy  here,  on  hand-made  paper.  .  .  ." 

"I  haven't  waited  for  that  to  read  it,"  said  Olivier,  who 
didn't  much  care  for  Passavant's  book,  and  tried  his  best  to 
be  amiable  without  being  fulsome. 

Did  Passavant  detect  in  his  tone  a  certain  tincture  of  dis- 
dain? He  went  on  quickly:  "Oh,  you  needn't  say  anything 
about  it.  If  you  were  to  tell  me  you  liked  it,  I  should  be  obliged 
to  doubt  either  your  taste  or  your  sincerity.  No;  no  one  knows 
better  than  I  do  what's  lacking  in  the  book.  I  wrote  it  much  too 
quickly.  To  tell  the  truth,  the  whole  time  I  was  writing  it  I 
was  thinking  of  my  next  one.  Ah !  that  one  is  a  different  matter. 
I  care  about  that  one.  Yes,  I  care  about  it  exceedingly.  You'll 
see;  you'll  see.  ...  I'm  so  very  sorry,  but  you  really  must 
leave  me  now.  .  .  .  Unless  .  .  .  No,  no;  we  don't  know  each 
other  well  enough  yet,  and  your  people  are  certainly  expecting 
you  back  for  dinner.  Well,  good-bye;  au  revoir.  I'll  write 
your  name  in  the  book;  allow  me." 

He  had  risen;  he  went  up  to  his  writing  desk.  While  he  was 
stooping  to  write,  Olivier  stepped  forward  and  glanced  out  of 
the  corner  of  his  eye  at  the  card  which  the  servant  had  just 
brought  in: 

VICTOR  STROUVILHOU 

The  name  meant  nothing  to  him. 

Passavant  handed  Olivier  the  copy  of  The  Hori^oiital  Bar, 
and  as  Olivier  was  preparing  to  read  the  inscription: 

"Look  at  it  later,"  said  Passavant,  slipping  the  book  under 
his  arm. 

It  was  not  till  he  was  in  the  street  that  Olivier  read  the 
manuscript  motto  with  which  the  Comte  de  Passavant  had 


129  OLIVIER  VISITS   PASSAVANT 

adorned  the  first  page  and  which  he  had  culled  out  of  the  book 
itself: 

"Prithee,  Orlando,  a  few  steps  further.  I  am  not  perfectly  sure 
that  I  dare  altogether  take  your  meaning." 

Underneath  which  he  had  added: 

To  OLIVIER  MOLINIER 

from  his  presumptive  friend 
COMTE  ROBERT  DE  PASSAVANT 

An  ambiguous  motto,  which  made  Olivier  wonder,  but 
which  after  all  he  was  perfectly  free  to  interpret  as  he  pleased. 

Olivier  got  home  just  after  Edouard  had  left,  weary  of 
waiting. 


VINCENT  AND   LILIAN 

Vincent's  education,  which  had  been  materialistic  in  tendency, 
prevented  him  from  believing  in  the  supernatural — which  gave 
the  demon  an  immense  advantage.  The  demon  never  made 
a  frontal  attack  upon  Vincent;  he  approached  him  crookedly 
and  furtively.  One  of  his  cleverest  manceuvres  consists  in  pre- 
senting us  our  defeats  as  if  they  were  victories.  What  inclined 
Vincent  to  consider  his  behaviour  to  Laura  as  a  victory  of  his 
will  over  his  affections,  was  that,  being  naturally  kind-hearted, 
he  had  been  obliged  to  force  himself,  to  steel  himself  to  be 
hard  to  her. 

Upon  a  closer  examination  of  the  evolution  of  Vincent's 
character  in  this  intrigue,  I  discover  various  stages,  which  I 
will  point  out  for  the  reader's  edification: 

1st. — The  period  of  good  motives.  Probity.  Conscientious 
need  of  repairing  a  wrong  action.  In  actual  fact:  the  moral 
obligation  of  devoting  to  Laura  the  money  which  his  parents 
had  laboriously  saved  to  meet  the  initial  expenses  of  his  career. 
Is  this  not  self-sacrifice?  Is  this  motive  not  respectable,  generous, 
charitable? 

2nd. — The  period  of  uneasiness.  Scruples.  Is  not  the  fear 
that  this  sum  may  be  insufficient,  the  first  step  towards  yield- 
ing, when  the  demon  dangles  before  Vincent's  eyes  the  pos- 
sibility of  increasing  it? 

3rd. — Constancy  and  fortitude.  Need  after  the  loss  of  this 
sum  to  feel  himself  "above  adversity."  It  is  this  "fortitude" 
which  enables  him  to  confess  his  loss  at  cards  to  Laura;  and 
which  enables  him  by  the  same  occasion  to  break  with  her. 

4th. — Renunciation  of  good  motives,  regarded  as  a  cheat,  in 
the  light  of  the  new  ethic  which  Vincent  finds  himself  obliged 


131  VINCENT   AND   LILIAN 

to  invent  in  order  to  legitimize  his  conduct;  for  he  continues 
to  be  a  moral  being,  and  the  devil  will  only  get  the  better  of 
him  by  furnishing  him  with  reasons  for  self-approval.  Theory 
of  immanence,  of  totality  in  the  moment;  of  gratuitous,  im- 
mediate and  motiveless  joy. 

5th. — Intoxication  of  the  winner.  Contempt  of  the  reserve 
in  hand.  Supremacy. 

After  which  the  demon  has  won  the  game. 

After  which  the  being  who  believes  himself  freest  is  nothing 
but  a  tool  at  his  service.  The  demon  will  never  rest  now  till 
Vincent  has  sold  his  brother  to  that  creature  of  perdition — 
Passavant. 

And  yet  Vincent  is  not  bad.  All  this,  do  what  he  will,  leaves 
him  unsatisfied,  uncomfortable.  Let  us  add  a  few  words  more: 

The  name  "exoticism"  is,  1  believe,  given  to  those  of  Maia's 
iridescent  folds  which  make  the  soul  feel  itself  a  stranger, 
which  deprive  it  of  points  of  contact.  There  are  some  whose 
virtue  would  resist,  but  that  the  devil,  before  attacking  it, 
transplants  them.  No  doubt,  if  Vincent  and  Laura  had  not  been 
under  other  skies,  far  from  their  parents,  from  their  past 
memories,  from  all  that  maintained  them  in  consistency  with 
themselves,  she  would  not  have  yielded  to  him,  nor  he  attempted 
to  seduce  her.  No  doubt  it  seemed  to  them  out  there  that 
their  act  did  not  enter  into  the  reckoning.  ...  A  great  deal 
more  might  be  said;  but  the  above  is  enough  as  it  is  to  ex- 
plain Vincent  to  us  better. 

With  Lilian  too  he  felt  himself  in  a  foreign  land. 

"Don't  laugh  at  me,  Lilian,"  he  said  to  her  that  same  evening. 
"I  know  that  you  won't  understand,  and  yet  I  have  to  speak  to 
you  as  if  you  would,  for  I'm  unable  now  to  get  you  out  of  my 
mind." 

Lilian  was  lying  on  the  low  divan,  and  he,  half  reclining  at 
her  feet,  let  his  head  rest,  lover-like,  on  his  mistress's  knees, 
while  she,  lover-like,  caressed  it. 

"The  thing  that  was  on  my  mind  this  morning  was  .  .  .  yes, 
I  think  it  was  fear.  Can  you  keep  serious  for  a  moment?  Can  you 
try  to  understand  me  so  far  as  to  forget  for  a  moment — not 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  132 

what  you  believe,  for  you  believe  in  nothing — but  just  that  very 
fact  that  you  believe  in  nothing?  I  didn't  believe  in  anything 
either;  I  believed  that  I  didn't  believe  in  anything — not  in  any- 
thing but  ourselves,  in  you,  in  me,  in  what  I  am  when  1  am 
with  you,  in  what,  thanks  to  you,  I  am  going  to  become.  ,  .  ." 

"Robert  will  be  here  at  seven,"  interrupted  Lilian.  "I  don't 
want  to  hurry  you;  but  if  you  don't  get  on  a  little  quicker,  he'll 
interrupt  you  just  at  the  "very  moment  you  are  beginning  to 
get  interesting.  I  don't  suppose  you'll  want  to  go  on  when  he's 
here.  It's  odd  that  you  should  think  it  necessary  to  take  so  many 
precautions  to-day.  You  remind  me  of  a  blind  man,  who  has 
first  to  feel  every  spot  with  his  stick,  before  he  puts  his  foot 
on  it.  And  yet  you  can  see  I'm  keeping  quite  serious.  Why 
haven't  you  more  confidence?" 

"Ever  since  I've  known  you,  my  confidence  has  become  ex- 
traordinary," went  on  Vincent.  "I'm  capable  of  great  things,  I 
feel  it;  and  you  see  that  everything  I  do  turns  out  successful. 
But  that's  exactly  what  terrifies  me.  No;  be  quiet.  ...  All  day 
long  I've  kept  thinking  of  what  you  told  me  this  morning  about 
the  wreck  of  the  Bourgogne,  and  of  the  people  who  wanted  to 
get  into  the  boat  having  their  hands  cut  off.  It  seems  to  me 
that  something  wants  to  get  into  my  boat — I'm  using  your 
image,  so  that  you  may  understand  me — something  that  I  want 
to  prevent  getting  in.  .  .  ." 

"And  you  want  me  to  help  you  drown  it.  .  .  .  You  old 
coward!" 

He  went  on  without  looking  at  her: 

"Something  I  keep  off,  but  whose  voice  I  hear  ...  a  voice 
you  have  never  heard,  that  I  listened  to  in  my  childhood.  .  .  ." 

"And  what  does  your  voice  say?  You  don't  dare  tell  me.  I'm 
not  surprised.  I  bet  there's  a  dash  of  the  catechism  in  it,  isn't 
there?" 

"Oh,  Lilian,  try  to  understand;  the  only  way  for  me  to  get 
rid  of  these  thoughts  is  to  tell  them  to  you.  If  you  laugh  at 
them,  1  shall  keep  them  to  myself  and  they'll  poison  me." 

"Tell  away  then,"  said  she  with  an  air  of  resignation.  Then, 


133  VINCENT  AND   LILIAN 

as  he  kept  silent  and  hid  his  face  like  a  child  in  Lilian's  skirts: 
"Well,  what  are  you  waiting  for?" 
She  seized  him  by  the  hair  and  forced  him  to  raise  his  head: 
"Upon  my  word,  he's  really  taking  it  seriously!  Just  look  at 
him!  He's  quite  pale.  Now,  listen  to  me,  my  dear  boy;  if  you 
mean  to  behave  like  a  child,  it's  not  my  affair  at  all.  One  must 
have  the  strength  of  one's  convictions.  And,  besides,  you  know 
I  don't  like  people  who  cheat.  When  you  try  on  the  sly  to  pull 
things  into  your  boat  which  oughtn't  to  be  there,  you're  cheat- 
ing. I'm  willing  to  play  the  game  with  you,  but  it  must  be 
above  board;  and  I  warn  you  my  object  is  to  make  you  succeed. 
I  think  you're  capable  of  becoming  somebody  important — really 
important;  I  feel  great  intelligence  in  you,  and  great  strength. 
I  want  to  help  you.  There  are  quite  enough  women  who  spoil 
the  careers  of  the  men  they  fall  in  love  with;  I  want  to  do  the 
contrary.  You've  already  told  me  you  wanted  to  give  up 
doctoring  in  order  to  work  at  science  and  that  you  were  sorry 
you  hadn't  enough  money.  .  .  .  Now  you  have  just  won  fifty 
thousand  francs,  which  isn't  bad  to  begin  with.  But  you  must 
promise  me  not  to  play  any  more.  I'll  put  as  much  money  as  is 
necessary  at  your  disposition,  on  condition  that  if  people  say 
you  are  being  kept,  you'll  be  strong-minded  enough  to  shrug 
your  shoulders." 

Vincent  had  risen.  He  went  up  to  the  window.  Lilian  went  on : 
"To  begin  with,  I  think  one  might  as  well  finish  up  with 
Laura  and  send  her  the  five  thousand  francs  you  promised  her. 
Now  that  you've  got  the  money,  why  don't  you  keep  your  word? 
I  don't  like  it  at  all.  I  detest  caddishness.  You  don't  know  how 
to  cut  hands  off  decently.  When  that's  done,  we'll  go  and  spend 
the  summer  where  it'll  be  most  profitable  for  your  work.  .  .  . 
You  mentioned  Roskoff;  personally,  I  should  prefer  Monaco, 
because  I  know  the  Prince,  and  he  might  take  us  for  a  cruise 
and  perhaps  give  you  a  job  in  his  laboratory." 

Vincent  kept  silent.  He  felt  disinclined  to  say  to  Lilian  (he 
only  told  her  later)  that  before  coming  to  see  her,  he  had  gone 
to  the  hotel,  where  Laura  had  waited  for  him  in  such  despair. 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  134 

Anxious  to  be  at  last  quit  of  his  debt,  he  had  slipped  the  notes, 
on  which  she  no  longer  counted,  into  an  envelope.  He  had  en- 
trusted the  envelope  to  a  waiter,  and  then  waited  in  the  hall 
until  he  should  hear  it  had  been  delivered  to  her  personally.  A 
few  moments  later  the  waiter  had  come  downstairs  bringing 
with  him  the  envelope,  across  which  Laura  had  written: 

"Too  late." 

Lilian  rang  and  asked  for  her  cloak.  When  the  maid  had  left 
the  room: 

"Oh,  I  wanted  to  say  to  you,  before  Robert  arrives,  that  if 
he  proposes  an  investment  for  your  fifty  thousand  francs — be 
careful.  He  is  very  rich,  but  he  is  always  in  want  of  money. 
There!  look  and  see.  I  think  I  hear  his  horn.  He's  half  an  hour 
before  the  time;  but  so  much  the  better.  .  .  .  For  all  we  were 
saying!  .  .  ." 


"I'm  early,"  said  Robert  as  he  came  into  the  room,  "because 
I  thought  it  would  be  amusing  to  go  and  dine  at  Versailles. 
Do  you  agree?" 

"No,"  said  Lady  Griffith;  "the  fountains  bore  me.  I  had 
rather  go  to  Rambouillet;  there's  time.  We  shan't  have  such  a 
good  dinner,  but  we  shall  be  able  to  talk  more  easily.  I  want 
Vincent  to  tell  you  his  fish  stories.  He  knows  some  marvellous 
ones.  1  don't  know  if  what  he  says  is  true,  but  it's  more  amusing 
than  the  best  novel  in  the  world." 

"That's  not  perhaps  what  a  novelist  will  think,"  said  Vincent. 

Robert  de  Passavant  held  an  evening  paper  in  his  hand: 

"D'you  know  that  Brugnard  has  just  been  made  assistant- 
secretary  at  the  Ministry  of  Justice?  Now's  the  moment  to  get 
your  father  decorated,"  said  he,  turning  to  Vincent.  Vincent 
shrugged  his  shoulders. 

"My  dear  Vincent,"  went  on  Passavant,  "allow  me  to  say  that 
you'll  very  much  offend  him  by  not  asking  this  little  favour — 
which  he'll  be  so  delighted  to  refuse." 

"Suppose  you  were  to  start  by  asking  it  for  yourself,"  Vincent 
replied. 

Robert  made  an  affected  little  grimace: 


135  VINCENT  AND   LILIAN 

"No;  for  my  part,  my  vanity  consists  in  never  blushing — 
not  even  in  my  buttonhole."  Then,  turning  to  Lilian: 

"Do  you  know  it's  rare  nowadays  to  find  a  man  who  has 
reached  forty  without  either  the  syph  or  the  legion  of  honour?" 

Lilian  smiled  and  shrugged  her  shoulders: 

"For  the  sake  of  a  bon-mot  he  actually  consents  to  make  him- 
self out  older  than  he  is!  I  say,  is  it  a  quotation  from  your 
next  book?  It'll  be  tasty.  ...  Go  on  downstairs.  I'll  get  my 
cloak  and  follow  you." 

"I  thought  you  had  given  up  seeing  him,"  said  Vincent  to 
Robert  on  the  staircase. 

"Who?  Brugnard?" 

"You  said  he  was  so  stupid.  .  .  ." 

"My  dear  friend,"  replied  Passavant,  pausing  on  a  step  and 
holding  up  Molinier,  for  he  saw  Lady  Griffith  coming  and 
wanted  her  to  hear:  "you  must  know  there's  not  a  single  one 
of  my  friends  whom  I've  known  a  certain  time,  that  hasn't 
given  me  unmistakable  proofs  of  imbecility.  I  assure  you  that 
Brugnard  resisted  the  test  longer  than  a  great  many  others." 

"Than  1,  perhaps?"  asked  Vincent. 

"Which  doesn't  prevent  me  from  being  your  best  friend  .  .  . 
as  you  see." 

"And  that's  what's  called  wit  in  Paris,"  said  Lilian,  who  had 
joined  them.  "Take  care,  Robert;  there's  nothing  fades  quicker." 

"Don't  be  alarmed,  dear  lady;  words  only  fade  when  they're 
printed." 

They  took  their  places  in  the  car  and  drove  off.  As  their 
conversation  continued  to  be  very  witty,  it  is  useless  to  record 
it  here.  They  sat  down  to  table  on  the  terrace  of  a  hotel  over- 
looking a  garden  where  the  shades  of  night  were  gathering. 
Under  cover  of  the  evening,  their  talk  grew  slower  and  graver; 
urged  on  by  Lilian  and  Robert,  Vincent  found  himself  at  last 
the  only  speaker. 


XVII 

THE   EVENING  AT   RAMBOUILLET 

"I  SHOULD  take  more  interest  in  animals  if  I  were  less  interested 
in  men,"  Robert  had  said.  And  Vincent  had  replied: 

"Perhaps  you  think  them  too  different.  Every  single  one  of 
the  great  discoveries  in  zoology  has  left  its  mark  upon  the  study 
of  man.  The  whole  subject  is  interlinked  and  interdependent, 
and  I  believe  that  a  novelist  who  also  prides  himself  upon 
being  a  psychologist  can  never  turn  aside  his  eyes  from  the 
spectacle  of  nature  and  remain  ignorant  of  her  laws  without 
paying  for  it.  In  the  Goncourts'  Journal,  which  you  gave  me  to 
read,  I  fell  upon  an  account  of  a  visit  they  paid  to  the  Zo- 
ological houses  in  the  Jardin  des  Plantes,  in  which  your  charm- 
ing authors  deplore  Nature's — or  the  Lord's — lack  of  imagina- 
tion. This  paltry  blasphemy  merely  serves  to  show  up  the 
stupidity  and  incomprehension  of  their  small  minds.  On  the 
contrary,  what  astonishing  diversity!  It  seems  as  if  Nature  had 
essayed  one  after  the  other  every  possible  manner  of  living  and 
moving,  as  if  she  had  taken  advantage  of  every  permission 
granted  by  matter  and  its  laws.  What  a  lesson  can  be  read  in 
the  progressive  abandonment  of  certain  palseontological  experi- 
ments which  proved  irrational  and  inelegant;  the  economy 
which  has  enabled  some  forms  to  survive  explains  why  the 
others  were  abandoned.  Botany  is  instructive,  too.  When  I  ex- 
amine a  plant,  I  observe  that  at  the  place  where  each  leaf 
springs  from  the  stem,  a  bud  lies  sheltered,  which  is  capable  in 
its  turn  of  shooting  into  life  the  following  year.  When  I  remark 
that  out  of  all  these  buds,  two  at  most  are  destined  to  come  to 
anything,  and  that  by  the  very  fact  of  their  growth  they  con- 
demn all  the  others  to  atrophy,  I  cannot  help  thinking  that  the 
case  is  the  same  with  men.  The  buds  which  develop  naturally 


137  AT   RAMBOUILLET 

are  always  the  terminal  buds — that  is  to  say,  those  that  are 
farthest  away  from  the  parent  trunk.  It  is  only  by  pruning  or 
layering  that  the  sap  is  driven  back  and  so  forced  to  give  life 
to  those  germs  which  are  nearest  the  trunk  and  which  would 
otherwise  have  lain  dormant.  And  in  this  manner,  the  most 
recalcitrant  plants,  which,  if  left  to  themselves,  would  no  doubt 
have  produced  nothing  but  leaves,  are  induced  to  bear  fruit. 
Oh!  an  orchard  or  a  garden  is  an  excellent  school!  and  a  horti- 
culturist would  often  make  the  best  of  pedagogues!  There  is 
more  to  be  learnt,  if  one  can  use  one's  eyes,  in  a  poultry-yard, 
or  a  kennel,  or  an  aquarium,  or  a  rabbit  warren,  or  a  stable, 
than  in  all  your  books,  or  even,  believe  me,  in  the  society  of 
men,  where  everything  is  more  or  less  sophisticated." 

Then  Vincent  spoke  of  selection.  He  explained  how  in  order 
to  obtain  the  finest  seedlings,  the  ordinary  plan  is  to  choose  the 
most  robust  specimens;  and  then  he  told  them  of  the  fantastic 
experiment  of  one  audacious  horticulturist,  who,  out  of  a  horror 
of  routine — it  really  seemed  almost  like  a  challenge — took  it 
into  his  head,  on  the  contrary,  to  select  the  most  weakly — with 
the  result  that  he  obtained  blooms  of  incomparable  beauty. 

Robert,  who  had  at  first  listened  with  only  half  an  ear,  like  a 
person  who  merely  expects  to  be  bored,  now  made  no  attempt 
to  interrupt.  His  attention  delighted  Lilian,  who  took  it  as  a 
compliment  to  her  lover. 

"You  ought  to  tell  us,"  said  she,  "of  what  you  were  saying 
the  other  day  about  fish  and  their  power  of  accommodation  to 
the  difi'erent  amounts  of  salt  in  the  sea.  .  .  .  That  was  it, 
wasn't  it?" 

"Except  for  certain  regions,"  went  on  Vincent,  "the  sea's  de- 
gree of  saltness  is  pretty  constant;  and  marine  fauna  as  a  rule 
tolerates  only  very  slight  variations  of  density.  But  the  regions 
I  was  telling  you  about  are  nevertheless  not  uninhabited;  the 
regions  I  mean  are  those  which  are  subject  to  intense  evapora- 
tion and  in  which,  therefore,  the  proportion  of  water  to  salt  is 
greatly  reduced — or,  on  the  contrary,  those  where  the  constant 
inflow  of  fresh  water  dilutes  the  salt  and,  so  to  speak,  un-salts 
the  sea — those  that  are  near  the  mouths  of  great  rivers,  or  such 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  138 

enormous  currents  as  the  Gulf  Stream.  In  such  regions  the 
animals  called  stenohalhu  grow  enfeebled  to  the  point  of  perish- 
ing; and  as  they  become  incapable  of  defending  themselves, 
they  inevitably  fall  a  prey  to  the  animals  called  euryhaline,  so 
that  the  euryhalines  live  by  choice  on  the  confines  of  the  great 
currents,  where  the  density  of  the  water  varies  and  where  the 
steiiohalines  meet  their  death.  You  understand,  don't  you,  that 
the  stenos  are  those  which  can  exist  only  in  water  whose  degree 
of  saltness  is  unvarying;  whilst  the  eurys  .  .  ." 

"Are  the  pickles,"  interrupted  Robert,^  who  always  referred 
everything  back  to  himself,  and  only  took  an  interest  in  that 
part  of  a  theory  which  he  could  turn  to  account. 

"JVIost  of  them  are  ferocious,"  added  Vincent  gravely. 

"I  told  you  it  was  better  than  any  novel!"  cried  Lilian,  ec- 
statically. 

Vincent  seemed  transfigured — indilTerent  to  the  impression  he 
was  making.  He  was  extraordinarily  grave  and  went  on  in  a 
lower  tone  as  if  he  were  talking  to  himself: 

"The  most  astonishing  discovery  of  recent  times — at  any  rate 
the  one  that  has  taught  me  most — is  the  discovery  of  the  photo- 
genic apparatus  of  deep-sea  creatures." 

"Oh,  tell  us  about  it!"  cried  Lilian,  letting  her  cigarette  go 
out  and  her  ice  melt  on  her  plate. 

"You  know,  no  doubt,  that  the  light  of  day  does  not  reach 
very  far  down  into  the  sea.  Its  depths  are  dark  .  .  .  huge  gulfs, 
which  for  a  long  time  were  thought  to  be  uninhabited;  then 
people  began  dragging  them,  and  quantities  of  strange  ani- 
mals were  brought  up  from  these  infernal  regions — animals 
that  were  blind,  it  was  thought.  What  use  would  the  sense  of 
sight  be  in  the  dark?  Evidently  they  had  no  eyes;  they  wouldn't, 
they  couldn't  have  eyes.  Nevertheless,  on  examination  it  was 
found  to  people's  amazement  that  some  of  them  had  eyes;  that 
they  almost  all  had  eyes,  and  sometimes  antennae  of  extraor- 
dinary sensibility  into  the  bargain.  Still  people  doubted  and 

1  Robert  here  makes  a  pun  impossible  to  translate.  Dessale  (literally 
unsalted)  is  a  slang  expression  meaning  something  like  unscrupulous. 

— Translator's  note. 


139  AT   RAMBOUILLET 

wondered:  why  eyes  with  no  means  of  seeing?  Eyes  that  are 
sensitive — but  sensitive  to  what?  .  .  .  And  at  last  it  was  dis- 
covered that  each  of  these  animals  which  people  at  first  insisted 
were  creatures  of  darkness,  gives  forth  and  projects  before  and 
around  it  its  own  light.  Each  of  them  shines,  illuminates,  ir- 
radiates. When  they  were  brought  up  from  the  depths  at  night 
and  turned  out  on  to  the  ship's  deck,  the  darkness  blazed.  Mov- 
ing, many-coloured  fires,  glowing,  vibrating,  changing — revolv- 
ing beacon-lamps — sparkling  of  stars  and  jewels — a  spectacle, 
say  those  who  saw  it,  of  unparalleled  splendour." 

Vincent  stopped.  No  one  spoke  for  a  long  time. 

"Let's  go  home,"  said  Lilian  suddenly;  "I'm  cold." 

Lady  Lilian  took  her  seat  beside  the  chauflFeur,  so  as  to  be 
sheltered  by  the  glass  screen.  The  two  men  at  the  back  of  the 
open  carriage  carried  on  their  own  conversation.  Robert  had 
hardly  spoken  during  the  whole  of  the  dinner;  he  had  listened 
to  Vincent  talking;  now  it  was  his  turn. 

"Fish  like  us,  my  dear  boy,  perish  in  calm  waters,"  said  he 
to  begin  with,  giving  his  friend  a  thump  on  the  shoulder.  He 
allowed  himself  a  few  familiarities  with  Vincent,  but  would  not 
have  suffered  him  to  reciprocate  them;  for  that  matter,  Vincent 
was  not  disposed  to.  "Do  you  know,  I  think  you're  simply 
splendid!  What  a  lecturer  you'd  make!  Upon  my  word,  you 
ought  to  quit  doctoring.  I  really  can't  see  you  prescribing  laxa- 
tives and  having  no  company  but  the  sick.  A  chair  of  compara- 
tive biology,  or  something  of  that  sort  is  what  you  want." 

"Yes,"  said  Vincent,  "I  have  sometimes  thought  so." 

"Lilian  ought  to  be  able  to  manage  it.  She  could  get  her 
friend  the  Prince  of  Monaco  to  interest  himself  in  your  re- 
searches. It's  his  line,  I  believe.  I  must  speak  to  her  about  it." 

"She  has  suggested  it  already." 

"Oh,  so  I  see  there's  no  possibility  of  doing  you  a  service," 
said  he,  pretending  to  be  vexed,  "Just  as  I  wanted  to  ask  you 
one  for  myself,  too." 

"It's  your  turn  to  be  in  my  debt.  You  think  I've  got  a  very 
short  memory." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  140 

"What?  You're  still  thinking  of  that  five  thousand  francs? 
But  you've  paid  it  back,  my  dear  fellow.  You  owe  me  nothing 
at  all  now — except  a  little  friendship,  perhaps."  He  added  these 
words  in  a  voice  that  was  almost  tender,  and  with  one  hand 
on  Vincent's  arm.  "I  want  to  appeal  to  it  now." 

"I  am  listening,"  said  Vincent. 

But  at  that,  Passavant  immediately  protested,  as  if  the  im- 
patience were  Vincent's,  and  not  his  own: 

"Goodness  me!  What  a  hurry  you're  in!  Between  this  and 
Paris  there's  time  enough  surely." 

Passavant  was  particularly  skilful  in  the  art  of  fathering 
his  own  words — and  anything  else  he  preferred  to  disown — on 
other  people.  He  made  a  feint  of  dropping  his  subject,  like  an 
angler  who,  for  fear  of  startling  his  trout,  makes  a  long  cast 
with  his  bait  and  then  draws  it  in  again  by  imperceptible 
degrees. 

"A  propos,  thank  you  for  sending  me  your  brother.  I  was 
afraid  you  had  forgotten." 

Vincent  made  a  gesture  and  Robert  went  on : 

"Have  you  seen  him  since?  .  .  .  Not  had  time,  eh?  .  .  . 
Then  it's  odd  you  shouldn't  have  asked  me  yet  how  the  inter- 
view went  off.  At  bottom,  you  don't  in  the  least  care.  You 
don't  take  the  faintest  interest  in  your  brother.  What  Olivier 
thinks  and  feels,  what  he  is,  what  he  wants  to  be,  never  con- 
cerns you  in  the  least.  .  .  ." 

"Reproaching  me?"  asked  Vincent. 

"Upon  my  soul,  yes.  I  can't  understand — I  can't  swallow 
your  indifference.  When  you  were  ill  at  Pau,  it  might  pass; 
you  could  only  think  of  yourself;  selfishness  was  part  of  the 
cure.  But  now  .  .  .  What!  you  have  growing  up  beside  you 
a  young  nature  quivering  with  life,  a  budding  intelligence,  full 
of  promise,  only  waiting  for  a  word  of  advice,  of  encourage- 
ment. .  .  ." 

He  forgot  as  he  spoke  that  he  too  had  a  brother. 

Vincent,  however,  was  no  fool;  the  very  exaggeration  of  this 
attack  showed  him  that  it  was  not  sincere  and  that  his  com- 


141  AT  RAMBOUILLET 

panion's  indignation  was  merely  brought  forward  to  pave  the 
way  for  something  else.  He  waited  in  silence.  But  Robert 
stopped  short  suddenly;  he  had  just  surprised  in  the  glimmer 
of  Vincent's  cigarette  a  curious  curl  of  his  lip,  which  he  took 
for  irony;  now  there  was  nothing  in  the  world  he  was  more 
afraid  of  than  being  laughed  at.  And  yet,  was  it  really  that 
which  made  him  change  his  tone?  I  wonder  whether  the  sudden 
intuition  of  a  kind  of  connivance  between  Vincent  and  him- 
self ...  He  assumed  an  air  of  perfect  naturalness  and  started 
again  in  the  tone  of  "there's  no  need  of  any  pretence  with 
you": 

"Well,  I  had  a  most  delightful  conversation  with  young 
Olivier.  I  like  the  boy  exceedingly." 

Passavant  tried  to  catch  Vincent's  expression  (the  night  was 
not  very  dark) ;  but  he  was  looking  fixedly  in  front  of  him. 

"And  now,  my  dear  Molinier,  the  service  I  wished  to  ask 
you  .  .  ." 

But,  here  again,  he  felt  the  need  of  marking  time,  something 
like  an  actor  who  drops  his  part  for  a  moment  with  the  as- 
surance that  he  has  his  audience  well  in  hand,  and  wishes  to 
prove  that  he  has,  both  to  himself  and  to  them.  He  bent  forward 
therefore  to  Lilian,  and  speaking  in  a  loud  voice  as  if  to  ac- 
centuate the  confidential  character  of  what  he  had  been  saying, 
and  of  what  he  was  going  to  say: 

"Are  you  sure,  dear  lady,  that  you  aren't  catching  cold?  We 
have  a  rug  here  that's  doing  nothing.  .  .  ." 

Then,  without  waiting  for  an  answer,  he  sank  back  into  the 
corner  of  the  carriage  beside  Vincent,  and  lowering  his  voice 
once  more: 

"This  is  what  it  is.  I  want  to  take  your  brother  away  with 
me  this  summer.  Yes;  I  tell  you  so  frankly;  what's  the  use 
of  beating  about  the  bush  between  us  two?  ...  I  haven't  the 
honour  of  being  acquainted  with  your  parents  and  of  course 
they  wouldn't  allow  Olivier  to  come  away  with  me  unless  you 
were  to  intervene  on  my  behalf.  No  doubt  you'll  find  a  way 
of  disposing  them  in  my  favour.  You  know  what  they're  like. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  142 

I  suppose,  and  you'll  be  able  to  get  round  them.  You'll  do 
this  for  me,  won't  you?" 

He  waited  a  moment,  and  then,  as  Vincent  kept  silent,  went 
on: 

"Look  here,  Vincent  ...  I'm  leaving  Paris  soon  ...  I  don't 
know  for  where  as  yet.  I  absolutely  must  have  a  secretary.  .  .  . 
You  know  I'm  founding  a  review.  I  have  spoken  about  it  to 
Olivier.  He  seems  to  me  to  have  all  the  necessary  qualities.  .  .  . 
But  I  don't  want  to  look  at  it  merely  from  my  own  selfish  point 
of  view:  I  also  think  that  this  will  be  an  opportunity  for  him 
to  show  all  his  qualities.  1  have  offered  him  the  place  of  edi- 
tor. .  .  .  Editor  of  a  review  at  his  age!  .  .  .  You  must  admit 
that  it's  unusual." 

"So  very  unusual,  that  I'm  afraid  my  parents  may  be  rather 
alarmed  by  it,"  said  Vincent  at  last,  turning  his  eyes  on  him 
and  looking  at  him  fixedly. 

"Yes;  you're  no  doubt  right.  Perhaps  it  would  be  better  not 
to  mention  that.  You  might  just  put  forward  the  interest  and 
advantage  it  would  be  for  him  to  go  travelling  with  me,  eh? 
Your  parents  must  understand  that  at  his  age  one  wants  to  see 
the  world  a  bit.  At  any  rate,  you'll  arrange  it  with  them,  won't 
you?" 

He  took  a  breath,  lighted  another  cigarette,  and  went  on  with- 
out changing  his  tone: 

"And  since  you're  going  to  be  so  nice,  I'll  try  and  do  some- 
thing for  you.  I  think  I  can  put  you  on  to  a  thing  which 
promises  to  turn  out  quite  exceptionally.  ...  A  friend  of 
mine  in  the  highest  banking  circles  is  keeping  it  open  for  a 
few  privileged  persons.  But  please  don't  mention  it;  not  a  word 
to  Lilian.  In  any  case  I  can  only  dispose  of  a  very  limited 
number  of  shares;  I  can't  offer  them  both  to  her  and  you  .  .  . 
Your  last  night's  fifty  thousand  francs?  .  .  ." 

"I  have  already  disposed  of  them,"  answered  Vincent  rather 
shortly,  for  he  remembered  Lilian's  warning. 

"All  right,  all  right.  .  .  ."  rejoined  Robert  quickly,  as  though 
he  were  a  little  piqued;  "I'm  not  insisting."  Then  with  the  air 
of  saying:  "I  can't  be  offended  with  you,"  he  added:  "If  you 


143  AT   RAMBOUILLET 

change  your  mind,  send  me  word  at  once  .  .  .  because  after 
five  o'clock  to-morrow  evening,  it'll  be  too  late." 

Vincent's  admiration  for  the  Comte  de  Passavant  had  be- 
come much  greater  since  he  had  ceased  to  take  him  seriously.

EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:   SECOND 
VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

Two  o'clock.  Lost  my  suit-case.  Serves  me  right.  There  was 
nothing  in  it  I  cared  about  but  my  journal.  But  I  cared  about 
that  too  much.  In  reality,  very  much  amused  by  the  adventure. 
All  the  same,  I  should  like  to  have  my  papers  back  again. 
Who  will  read  them?  .  .  .  Perhaps  now  that  I  have  lost  them, 
I  exaggerate  their  importance.  The  book  I  have  lost  came  to  an 
end  with  my  journey  to  England.  When  I  was  over  there,  I 
used  another  one,  which  I  shall  give  up  writing  in,  now  that 
I  am  back  in  France.  I  shall  take  good  care  not  to  lose  this 
one,  in  which  I  am  writing  now.  It  is  my  pocket-mirror.  I 
cannot  feel  that  anything  that  happens  to  me  has  any  real 
existence  until  I  see  it  reflected  here.  But  since  my  return  I 
seem  to  be  walking  in  a  dream.  What  a  miserable  uphill  affair 
my  conversation  with  Olivier  was!  And  I  had  been  looking 
forward  to  it  with  such  joy.  ...  I  hope  it  has  left  him  as  ill- 
satisfied  as  it  has  me — as  ill-satisfied  with  himself  as  with  me. 
I  was  no  more  able  to  talk  than  to  get  him  to  talk.  Oh,  how 
difficult  the  slightest  word  is,  when  it  involves  the  whole  assent 
of  the  whole  being!  When  the  heart  comes  into  play,  it  numbs 
and  paralyses  the  brain. 

Seven  o'clock.  Found  my  suit-case;  or  at  any  rate  the  person 
who  took  it.  The  fact  that  he  is  Olivier's  most  intimate  friend 
makes  a  link  between  us  which  it  rests  only  with  me  to  tighten. 
The  danger  is  that  anything  unexpected  amuses  me  so  intensely 
that  I  lose  sight  of  my  goal. 

Seen  Laura.  My  desire  to  oblige  people  becomes  more  acute 
if  there  is  a  difficulty  to  be  encountered,  if  a  struggle  has  to 
be  waged  with  convention,  banality  and  custom. 


145  SECOND  VISIT  TO  LA  PEROUSE 

Visit  to  old  La  Perouse.  It  was  Madame  de  La  Perouse 
who  opened  the  door  to  me.  I  have  not  seen  her  for  more  than 
two  years;  she  recognized  me,  however,  at  once.  (I  don't  sup- 
pose they  have  many  visitors.)  She  herself  for  that  matter  is 
very  little  changed;  but  (is  it  because  1  have  a  prejudice  against 
her?)  I  thought  her  features  harder,  her  expression  sourer,  her 
smile  falser  than  ever. 

"I  am  afraid  Monsieur  de  La  Perouse  is  in  no  state  to  re- 
ceive you,"  said  she  at  once,  with  the  obvious  desire  of  getting 
me  to  herself;  then,  taking  advantage  of  her  deafness  in  order 
to  answer  before  I  had  questioned  her: 

"No,  no;  you're  not  disturbing  me  in  the  least.  Do  come  in." 

She  showed  me  into  the  room  where  La  Perouse  gives  his 
music  lessons,  the  two  windows  of  which  look  on  to  the  court- 
yard. And  as  soon  as  she  had  got  me  safely  inside: 

"I  am  particularly  glad  to  have  a  word  with  you  alone. 
Monsieur  de  La  Perouse — I  know  what  an  old  and  faithful 
friend  of  his  you  are — is  in  a  state  which  causes  me  great 
anxiety.  Couldn't  you  persuade  him  to  take  more  care  of  him- 
self? He  listens  to  you;  as  for  me,  I  might  as  well  talk  to  the 
winds." 

And  thereupon  she  entered  upon  an  endless  series  of  re- 
criminations: the  old  gentleman  refuses  to  take  care  of  him- 
self, simply  in  order  to  annoy  her;  he  does  everything  he 
oughtn't  to  do  and  nothing  that  he  ought;  he  goes  out  in  all 
weathers  and  will  never  consent  to  put  on  a  muffler;  he  re- 
fuses to  eat  at  meals — "Monsieur  isn't  hungry" — and  nothing  she 
can  contrive  tempts  his  appetite;  but  at  night,  he  gets  up  and 
turns  the  kitchen  upside  down,  cooking  himself  some  mess  or 
other. 

I  have  no  doubt  the  old  lady  didn't  invent  anything;  I 
could  make  out  from  her  tale  that  it  was  her  interpretation 
alone  which  gave  an  offensive  meaning  to  the  most  innocent 
little  facts  and  that  reality  had  cast  a  monstrous  shadow  on  the 
walls  of  her  narrow  brain.  But  does  not  her  old  husband  on  his 
side  misinterpret  all  his  wife's  attentions?  She  thinks  herself  a 
martyr,  while  he  takes  her  for  a  torturer.  As  for  judging  them. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  146 

understanding  them,  I  give  it  up;  or  rather,  as  always  happens, 
the  better  I  understand  them,  the  more  tempered  my  judgment 
of  them  becomes.  But  this  remains — that  here  are  two  beings 
tied  to  each  other  for  life  and  causing  each  other  abominable 
suffering.  I  have  often  noticed  with  married  couples  how  in- 
tolerably irritating  the  slightest  protuberance  of  character  in 
the  one  may  be  to  the  other,  because  in  the  course  of  life  in 
common  it  continually  rubs  up  against  the  same  place.  And 
if  the  rub  is  reciprocal,  married  life  is  nothing  but  a  hell. 

Beneath  her  smoothly  parted  black  wig,  which  makes  the 
features  of  her  chalky  face  look  harder  still,  with  her  long  black 
mittens,  from  which  protrude  little  claw-like  fingers,  Madame 
de  La  Perouse  has  the  appearance  of  a  harpy. 

"He  accuses  me  of  spying  on  him,"  she  continued.  "He  has 
always  needed  a  great  deal  of  sleep;  but  at  night  he  makes  a 
show  of  going  to  bed,  and  then  when  he  thinks  I  am  fast  asleep, 
he  gets  up  again;  he  muddles  about  among  his  old  papers,  and 
sometimes  stays  up  till  morning  reading  his  late  brother's 
letters  and  crying  over  them.  And  he  wants  me  to  bear  it  all 
without  a  word!" 

Then  she  went  on  to  complain  that  he  wanted  to  make  her 
go  into  a  home;  which  would  be  all  the  more  painful  to  her,  she 
added,  as  he  was  quite  incapable  of  living  alone  and  doing 
without  her  care.  This  was  said  in  a  tearful  tone,  which  was 
only  too  obviously  hypocritical. 

Whilst  she  was  continuing  her  grievances,  the  drawing-room 
door  opened  gently  behind  her  and  La  Perouse  came  in,  with- 
out her  hearing  him.  At  his  wife's  last  words  he  smiled  at 
me  ironically,  and  touched  his  head  with  his  hand  to  signify 
she  was  mad.  Then,  with  an  impatience — a  brutality  even — 
of  which  I  should  not  have  thought  him  capable,  and  which 
seemed  to  justify  the  old  woman's  accusations  (but  it  was  due 
too  to  his  having  to  raise  his  voice  to  a  shout  in  order  to  make 
himself  heard) : 

"Come,  Madam,"  he  cried,  "you  ought  to  understand  that 
you  are  tiring  this  gentleman  with  your  talk.  He  didn't  come 
to  see  you.  Leave  the  room." 


147  SECOND  VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

The  old  lady  protested  that  the  arm-chair  she  was  sitting 
in  was  her  own  and  that  she  was  not  going  to  quit  it. 

"In  that  case,"  went  on  La  Perouse  with  a  grim  chuckle, 
"we  will  leave  you."  Then,  turning  to  me,  he  repeated  in  gentler 
tones,  "come,  let  us  leave  her." 

I  made  a  sketchy  and  embarrassed  bow,  and  followed  him 
into  the  next  room — the  same  one  in  which  I  had  paid  him 
my  last  visit. 

"I  am  glad  you  heard  her,"  he  said;  "that's  what  it's  like 
the  whole  day  long." 

He  shut  the  window. 

"There's  such  a  noise  in  the  street,  one  can't  hear  oneself 
speak.  I  spend  my  time  shutting  the  windows  and  Madame  de 
La  Perouse  spends  hers  opening  them  again.  She  declares  she's 
stifling.  She  always  exaggerates.  She  refuses  to  realize  that  it's 
hotter  out  of  doors  than  in.  And  yet  I've  got  a  little  ther- 
mometer; but  when  I  show  it  to  her,  she  says  that  figures  prove 
nothing.  She  wants  to  be  right  even  when  she  knows  she's 
wrong.  Her  main  object  in  life  is  to  annoy  me." 

He  himself,  while  he  was  speaking,  seemed  to  me  a  little 
off  his  balance;  he  went  on  with  growing  excitement: 

"Everything  she  does  amiss  in  life  she  sets  down  as  a  griev- 
ance against  me.  All  her  judgments  are  warped.  I'll  just  ex- 
plain to  you  how  it  is:  You  know  our  impressions  of  outside 
images  come  to  us  reversed  and  that  there's  an  apparatus  in 
our  brains  which  sets  them  right  again.  Well,  Madame  de  La 
Perouse  has  no  such  apparatus  for  setting  them  right.  In  her 
brain  they  remain  upside  down.  You  can  see  for  yourself  how 
painful  it  is." 

It  was  certainly  a  great  relief  to  him  to  explain  himself  and 
I  took  care  not  to  interrupt  him.  He  went  on: 

"Madame  de  La  Perouse  has  always  eaten  much  too  much. 
Well,  now  she  makes  out  that  it's  I  who  eat  too  much.  If  she  sees 
me  presently  with  a  bit  of  chocolate  (it's  my  chief  nourishment) 
she'll  be  certain  to  mutter,  'Munching  again!  .  .  .'  She  spies  on 
me.  She  accuses  me  of  getting  up  in  the  night  to  eat  on  the  sly, 
because  she  once  surprised  me  making  myself  a  cup  of  chocolate 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  148 

in  the  kitchen.  .  .  .  What  am  I  to  do?  When  I  see  her  opposite 
me  at  table,  falling  ravenously  upon  her  food,  as  she  does, 
it  takes   away  my  appetite  entirely.   Then   she  declares   I'm 
pretending  to  be  fastidious  just  to  torment  her." 
He  paused,  and  then  in  a  sort  of  lyrical  outburst: 
"Her  reproaches  amaze  me!  .  .  .  For  instance,  when  she  is 
suffering  from  her  sciatica,  I  condole  with  her.  Then  she  stops 
me,  shrugs  her  shoulders  and  says:  'Don't  pretend  you  have 
a  heart.'  Everything  I  do  or  say  is  in  order  to  give  her  pain." 
We  had  seated  ourselves,  but  all  the  time  he  was  speaking, 
he  kept  getting  up  and  sitting  down  again,  in  a  state  of  morbid 
restlessness. 

"Would  you  believe  that  in  each  of  these  rooms  there  are 
some  pieces  of  furniture  which  belong  to  her  and  others  to 
me?  You  saw  her  just  now  with  her  arm-chair.  She  says  to  the 
charwoman,  when  she's  doing  the  room,  "No,  that's  Monsieur's 
chair;  don't  touch  that."  And  the  other  day,  when  by  mistake 
I  put  a  bound  music-book  on  a  little  table  which  belongs  to 
her,  Madam  knocked  it  on  to  the  ground.  Its  corners  were 
broken.  ,  .  .  Oh,  it  can't  last  much  longer.  .  .  .  But,  lis- 
ten ,  .  ." 

He  seized  me  by  the  arm,  and  lowering  his  voice: 
"I  have  taken  steps.  She  is  continually  threatening  me  if  I 
'go  on!'  to  take  refuge  in  a  home.  I  have  set  aside  a  certain  sum 
of  money  which  ought  to  be  enough  to  pay  for  her  at  Sainte- 
Perine's;  I  hear  it's  an  excellent  place.  The  few  lessons  I  still 
give,  bring  me  in  hardly  anything.  In  a  little  time  I  shall 
be  at  the  end  of  my  resources;  I  should  be  forced  to  break  into 
this  sum — and  I'm  determined  not  to.  So  I  have  made  a 
resolution.  ...  It  will  be  in  a  little  over  three  months.  Yes; 
I  have  fixed  the  date.  If  you  only  knew  what  a  relief  it  is  to 
think  that  every  hour  it  draws  nearer." 

He  had  bent  towards  me;  he  bent  closer  still: 

"And  I  have  put  aside  a  Government  bond.  Oh,  it's  not  much. 

But  I  couldn't  do  more.  Madame  de  La  Perouse  doesn't  know 

about  it.   It's  in  my  bureau  in  an  envelope  directed  to  you, 

with  the  necessary  instructions.  I  know  nothing  about  business. 


149  SECOND  VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

but  a  solicitor  whom  I  consulted,  told  me  that  the  interest 
could  be  paid  directly  to  my  grandson,  until  he  is  of  age,  and 
that  then  he  would  have  the  security.  I  thought  it  wouldn't 
be  too  great  a  tax  on  your  friendship  to  ask  you  to  see  that 
this  is  done.  I  have  so  little  confidence  in  solicitors!  .  .  .  And 
even,  if  you  wished  to  make  me  quite  easy,  you  v^ould  take 
charge  of  the  envelope  at  once.  .  .  .  You  will,  won't  you?  .  .  . 
I'll  go  and  fetch  it." 

He  trotted  out  in  his  usual  fashion  and  came  back  with  a 
large  envelope  in  his  hand. 

"You'll  excuse  me  for  having  sealed  it;  for  form's  sake," 
said  he.  "Take  it." 

I  glanced  at  it  and  saw  under  my  name  the  words  "To  be 
opened  after  my  death"  written  in  printed  letters. 

"Put  it  in  your  pocket  quick,  so  that  I  may  know  it's  safe. 
Thank  you.  .  .  .  Oh,  I  was  so  longing  for  you  to  come!  .  .  ." 

I  have  often  experienced  that,  in  moments  as  solemn  as  this, 
all  human  emotion  is  transformed  into  an  almost  mystic  ecstasy, 
into  a  kind  of  enthusiasm,  in  which  my  whole  being  is  magnified, 
or  rather  liberated  from  all  selfishness,  as  though  dispossessed 
of  itself  and  depersonalized.  Those  who  have  never  experienced 
this  will  certainly  not  understand  me.  But  I  felt  that  La  Perouse 
understood.  Any  protestation  on  my  part  would  have  been 
superfluous,  would  have  seemed  unbecoming,  I  thought,  and  I 
contented  myself  with  pressing  the  hand  which  he  gave  me. 
His  eyes  were  shining  with  a  strange  brightness.  In  his  free 
hand,  in  which  he  had  at  first  been  holding  the  envelope,  was 
another  piece  of  paper. 

"I  have  written  his  address  down  here.  For  I  know  now 
where  he  is.  At  Saas-Fee.  Do  you  know  it?  It's  in  Switzerland. 
I  looked  for  it  on  the  map,  but  I  couldn't  find  it." 

"Yes,"  I  said.  "It's  a  little  village  near  the  Matterhorn." 

"Is  it  very  far?" 

"Not  so  far  but  that  I  might  perhaps  go  there." 

"Really?  Would  you  really?  .  .  .  Oh,  howr  good  you  are!" 
said  he.  "As  for  me,  I'm  too  old.  And  besides,  I  can't  because 
of  his  mother.  ...  All  the  same,  I  think  .  .  ."  He  hesitated  for 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  150 

a  word,  then  went  on :  "that  I  should  depart  more  easily,  if  only 
I  had  been  able  to  see  him." 

"My  poor  friend.  .  .  .  Everything  that  is  humanly  possible 
to  do  to  bring  him  to  you,  I  will  do.  You  shall  see  little  Boris, 
I  promise  you." 

"Thank  you!  .  .  .  Thank  you!" 

He  pressed  me  convulsively  in  his  arms. 

"But  promise  me  that  you  won't  think  of  .  .  ." 

"Oh,  that's  another  matter,"  said  he,  interrupting  me 
abruptly.  Then  immediately  and  as  if  he  were  trying  to  prevent 
me  from  going  on  by  distracting  my  attention: 

"What  do  you  think,  the  other  day,  the  mother  of  one  of  my 
pupils  insisted  on  taking  me  to  the  theatre!  About  a  month 
ago.  It  was  a  matinee  at  the  Theatre  Frangais.  I  hadn't  been 
inside  a  theatre  for  more  than  twenty  years.  They  were  giving 
Hernani  by  Victor  Hugo.  You  know  it?  It  seems  that  it  was 
very  well  acted.  Everybody  was  in  raptures.  As  for  me,  I 
suffered  indescribably.  If  politeness  hadn't  kept  me  there,  I 
shouldn't  have  been  able  to  stay  it  out.  .  .  .  We  were  in  a  box. 
My  friends  did  their  best  to  calm  me.  I  wanted  to  apostrophize 
the  audience.  Oh!  how  can  people?  How  can  people?  .  .  ." 

Not  understanding  at  first  what  it  was  he  objected  to,  1 
asked: 

"You  thought  the  actors  very  bad?" 

"Of  course.  But  how  can  people  represent  such  abominations 
on  the  stage?  .  .  .  And  the  audience  applauded.  And  there  were 
children  in  the  theatre — children,  brought  there  by  their  par- 
ents, who  knew  the  play.  .  .  .  Monstrous!  And  that,  in  a 
theatre  subsidized  by  the  State!" 

The  worthy  man's  indignation  amused  me.  By  now  I  was 
almost  laughing.  I  protested  that  there  could  be  no  dramatic 
art  without  a  portrayal  of  the  passions.  In  his  turn,  he  de- 
clared that  the  portrayal  of  the  passions  must  necessarily  be 
an  undesirable  example.  The  discussion  continued  in  this  way 
for  some  time;  and  as  I  was  comparing  this  portrayal  of  the 
passions  to  the  effect  of  letting  loose  the  brass  instruments  in 
an  orchestra : 


151  SECOND  VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

■'Tor  instance,  the  entry  of  the  trombones  in  such  and  such  a 
symphony  of  Beethoven's  which  you  admire.  .  .  ." 

"But  I  don't,  I  don't  admire  the  entry  of  the  trombones," 
cried  he,  with  extraordinary  violence.  "Why  do  you  want  to 
make  me  admire  what  disturbs  me?" 

His  whole  body  was  trembling.  The  indignant — the  almost 
hostile  tone  of  his  voice  surprised  me  and  seemed  to  astonish 
even  himself,  for  he  went  on  more  calmly: 

"Have  you  observed  that  the  whole  effect  of  modern  music 
is  to  make  bearable,  and  even  agreeable,  certain  harmonies 
which  we  used  to  consider  discords?" 

"Exactly,"  I  rejoined.  "Everything  must  finally  resolve  into 
— be  reduced  to  harmony." 

"Harmony!"  he  repeated,  shrugging  his  shoulders.  "All  that 
I  can  see  in  it  is  familiarization  with  evil — with  sin.  Sensibility 
is  blunted;  purity  is  tarnished;  reactions  are  less  vivid;  one 
tolerates;  one  accepts.  .  .  ." 

"To  listen  to  you,  one  would  never  dare  wean  a  child." 

But  he  went  on  without  hearing  me:  "If  one  could  recover 
the  uncompromising  spirit  of  one's  youth,  one's  greatest  in- 
dignation would  be  for  what  one  has  become." 

It  was  impossible  to  start  on  a  teleological  argument;  I 
tried  to  bring  him  back  to  his  own  ground: 

"But  you  don't  pretend  to  restrict  music  to  the  mere  ex- 
pression of  serenity,  do  you?  In  that  case,  a  single  chord  would 
suffice — a  perfect  and  continuous  chord." 

He  took  both  my  hands  in  his,  and  in  a  burst  of  ecstasy,  his 
eyes  rapt  in  adoration,  he  repeated  several  times  over: 

"A  perfect  and  continuous  chord;  yes,  yes;  a  perfect  and 
continuous  chord.  ,  .  .  But  our  whole  universe  is  a  prey  to 
discord,"  he  added  sadly. 

I  took  my  leave.  He  accompanied  me  to  the  door  and  as  he 
embraced  me,  murmured  again: 

"Oh!  How  long  shall  we  have  to  wait  for  the  resolution  of 
the  chord?" 


SECOND  PART 
SAAS -FEE 


FROM   BERNARD  TO  OLIVIER 

Monday 
My  Dear  Old  Olivier, 

First  I  must  tell  you  that  I've  cut  the  "bachot."  I  expect 
you  understood  as  much  when  I  didn't  turn  up.  I  shall  go  in  for 
it  next  October.  An  unparelleled  opportunity  to  go  travelling 
was  offered  me.  I  jumped  at  it  and  I'm  not  sorry  1  did.  I  had 
to  make  up  my  mind  at  once — without  taking  time  to  reflect — 
without  even  saying  good-bye  to  you.  A  propos,  my  travelling 
companion  tells  me  to  say  how  sorry  he  is  he  had  to  leave 
without  seeing  you  again.  For  do  you  know  who  carried  me 
off?  You've  guessed  it  already.  ...  It  was  Edouard — yes!  that 
same  uncle  of  yours,  whom  I  met  the  very  day  he  arrived  in 
Paris,  in  rather  extraordinary  and  sensational  circumstances, 
which  I'll  tell  you  about  some  day.  But  everything  in  this  ad- 
venture is  extraordinary,  and  when  I  think  of  it  my  head 
whirls.  Even  now,  I  can  hardly  believe  it  is  true  and  that  I 
am  really  here  in  Switzerland  with  Edouard  and  .  .  .  Well! 
I  see  I  must  tell  you  the  whole  story,  but  mind  you  tear  my 
letter  up  and  never  breathe  a  word  about  it  to  a  soul. 

Just  think,  the  poor  woman  your  brother  Vincent  abandoned, 
the  one  you  heard  sobbing  outside  your  door  (1  must  say,  it 
was  idiotic  of  you  not  to  open  it)  turns  out  to  be  a  great  friend 
of  Edouard's  and  moreover  is  actually  a  daughter  of  Vedel's 
and  a  sister  of  your  friend  Armand's.  I  oughtn't  to  be  writing 
you  all  this,  because  a  woman's  honour  is  at  stake,  but  I  should 
burst  if  I  didn't  tell  someone.  ...  So,  once  more,  don't  breathe 
a  word!  You  know  that  she  married  recently;  perhaps  you 
know  that  shortly  after  her  marriage  she  fell  ill  and  went  for 
a  cure  to  the  South  of  France.  That's  where  she  met  Vincent — 
in  the  sanatorium  at  Pau.  Perhaps  you  know  that,  too.  But 
what  you  don't  know  is  that  there  were  consequences.  Yes,  old 
boy!  She's  going  to  have  a  child  and  it's  your  clumsy  ass  of 
a  brother's  fault.  She  came  back  to  Paris  and  didn't  dare  show 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  156 

herself  to  her  parents;  still  less  go  back  to  her  husband.  And 
then  your  brother,  as  you  know,  chucked  her.  I'll  spare  you 
my  comments;  but  I  can  tell  you  that  Laura  Douviers  has  not 
uttered  a  word  against  him,  either  of  reproach  or  resentment. 
On  the  contrary,  she  says  all  she  can  think  of  to  excuse  his  con- 
duct. In  a  word,  she's  a  very  fine  woman,  with  a  very  beautiful 
nature.  And  another  very  fine  person  is  Edouard.  As  she  didn't 
know  what  to  do  or  where  to  go,  he  proposed  taking  her  to 
Switzerland;  and  at  the  same  time  he  proposed  that  I  should 
go  with  them,  because  he  didn't  care  about  travelling  tete 
a  tete,  as  he  is  only  on  terms  of  friendship  with  her.  So  off 
we  started.  It  was  all  settled  in  a  jiffy — just  time  to  pack  one's 
suit-case  and  for  me  to  get  a  kit  (for  you  know  I  left  home 
without  a  thing).  You  can't  imagine  how  nice  Edouard  was 
about  it;  and  what's  more  he  kept  repeating  all  the  time  that 
it  was  1  who  was  doing  him  a  service.  Yes,  really,  old  boy, 
you  were  quite  right,  your  uncle's  perfectly  splendid. 

The  journey  was  rather  troublesome,  because  Laura  got  very 
tired  and  her  condition  (she's  in  her  third  month)  necessitated 
a  great  deal  of  care;  and  the  place  where  we  had  settled  to  go 
(it  would  be  too  long  to  explain  why)  is  rather  difficult  to  get 
at.  Besides,  Laura  very  often  made  things  more  complicated 
by  refusing  to  take  precautions;  she  had  to  be  forced;  she 
kept  repeating  that  an  accident  was  the  best  thing  that  could 
happen  to  her.  You  can  imagine  how  we  fussed  over  her.  Oh, 
Olivier,  how  wonderful  she  is!  I  don't  feel  the  same  as  I  did 
before  I  knew  her,  and  there  are  thoughts  which  I  no  longer 
dare  put  into  words  and  impulses  which  I  check,  because  I 
should  be  ashamed  not  to  be  worthy  of  her.  Yes,  really,  when 
one  is  with  her,  one  feels  forced,  as  it  were,  to  think  nobly. 
That  doesn't  prevent  the  conversation  between  the  three  of  us 
from  being  very  free — Laura  isn't  at  all  prudish — and  we  talk 
about  anything;  but  I  assure  you  that  when  I  am  with  her, 
there  are  heaps  of  things  I  don't  feel  inclined  to  scoff'  at  any 
more  and  which  seem  to  me  now  very  serious. 

You'll  be  thinking  I'm  in  love  with  her.  Well,  old  boy,  you 
aren't  far  wrong.  Crazy,  isn't  it?  Can  you  imagine  me  in  love 
with  a  woman  who  is  going  to  have  a  child,  whom  naturally 
I  respect  and  wouldn't  venture  to  touch  with  my  finger-tip? 
Hardly  on  the  road  to  becoming  a  rake,  am  I?  .  .  . 


157  BERNARD  TO  OLIVIER 

When  we  reached  Saas-Fe,  after  no  end  of  difficulties  (we 
had  a  carrying  chair  for  Laura,  as  it's  impossible  to  get  here 
by  driving),  we  found  there  were  only  two  rooms  available  in 
the  hotel — a  big  one  with  two  beds,  and  a  little  one,  which  it 
was  settled  with  the  hotel-keeper  should  be  for  me — for  Laura 
passes  as  Edouard's  wife,  so  as  to  conceal  her  identity;  but 
every  night  she  sleeps  in  the  little  room  and  I  join  Edouard 
in  his.  Every  morning  there's  a  regular  business  carrying  things 
backwards  and  forwards,  for  the  sake  of  the  servants.  Fortu- 
nately the  two  rooms  communicate,  so  that  makes  it  easier. 

We've  been  here  six  days;  I  didn't  write  to  you  sooner  because 
I  was  rather  in  a  state  of  bewilderment  to  begin  with,  and  I 
had  to  get  straight  with  myself.  I  am  only  just  beginning  to 
find  my  bearings. 

Edouard  and  I  have  already  done  one  or  two  little  excursions 
in  the  mountains.  Very  amusing;  but  to  tell  the  truth,  I  don't 
much  care  for  this  country.  Edouard  doesn't  either.  He  says 
the  scenery  is  "declamatory."  That's  exactly  it. 

The  best  thing  about  the  place  is  the  air — virgin  air,  which 
purifies  one's  lungs.  And  then  we  don't  want  to  leave  Laura 
alone  for  too  long  at  a  time,  for  of  course  she  can't  come  with 
us.  The  company  in  the  hotel  is  rather  amusing.  There  are 
people  of  all  sorts  of  nationalities.  The  person  we  see  most  of 
is  a  Polish  woman  doctor,  who  is  spending  the  holidays  here 
with  her  daughter  and  a  little  boy  she  is  in  charge  of.  In  fact, 
it's  because  of  this  little  boy  that  we  have  come  here.  He's  got 
a  kind  of  nervous  illness,  which  the  doctor  is  treating  according 
to  a  new  method.  But  what  does  the  little  fellow  most  good 
(he's  really  a  very  attractive  little  thing)  is  that  he's  madly 
in  love  with  the  doctor's  daughter,  who  is  a  year  or  two  older 
than  he  and  the  prettiest  creature  I  have  ever  seen  in  my  life. 
They  never  leave  each  other  from  morning  till  night.  And 
they  are  so  charming  together  that  no  one  ever  thinks  of  chaffing 
them. 

I  haven't  worked  much  and  not  opened  a  book  since  I  left; 
but  I've  thought  a  lot.  Edouard's  conversation  is  extraordinarily 
interesting.  He  doesn't  speak  to  me  much  personally,  though  he 
pretends  to  treat  me  as  his  secretary;  but  I  listen  to  him  talking 
to  the  others;  especially  to  Laura,  with  whom  he  likes  discussing 
his  ideas.  You  can't  imagine  how  much  I  learn  by  it.  There 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  158 

are  days  when  I  say  to  myself  that  I  ought  to  take  notes;  but 
I  think  I  can  remember  it  all.  There  are  days  when  I  long  for 
you  madly;  I  say  to  myself  that  it's  you  who  ought  to  be  here; 
but  I  can't  be  sorry  for  what's  happened  to  me,  nor  wish  for 
anything  to  be  different.  At  any  rate,  you  may  be  sure  that  I 
never  forget  it's  thanks  to  you  that  I  know  Edouard  and  that 
it's  to  you  I  owe  my  happiness.  When  you  see  me  again,  I 
think  you'll  find  me  changed;  I  remain,  nevertheless,  and  more 
faithfully  and  devotedly  than  ever 

Your  friend. 

P.S.  Wednesday.  We  have  this  moment  come  back  from  a 
tremendous  expedition.  Climbed  the  Hallalin — guides,  ropes, 
glaciers,  precipes,  avalanches,  etc.  Spent  the  night  in  a  refuge 
in  the  middle  of  the  snows,  packed  in  with  other  tourists; 
needless  to  say  we  didn't  sleep  a  wink.  The  next  morning  we 
started  before  dawn.  .  .  .  Well,  old  boy,  I'll  never  speak  ill 
of  Switzerland  again.  When  one  gets  up  there,  out  of  sight  of 
all  culture,  of  all  vegetation,  of  everything  that  reminds  one 
of  the  avarice  and  stupidity  of  men,  one  feels  inclined  to  shout, 
to  sing,  to  laugh,  to  cry,  to  fly,  to  dive  head  foremost  into  the 
sky,  or  to  fall  on  one's  knees.  Yours 

Bernard. 

Bernard  was  much  too  spontaneous,  too  natural,  too  pure — 
he  knew  too  little  of  Olivier,  to  suspect  the  flood  of  hideous 
feelings  his  letter  would  raise  in  his  friend's  heart — a  kind  of 
tidal  wave,  in  which  pique,  despair  and  rage  were  mingled. 
He  felt  himself  supplanted  in  Bernard's  affection  and  in 
Edouard's.  The  friendship  of  his  two  friends  left  no  room  for 
his.  One  sentence  in  particular  of  Bernard's  letter  tortured  him 
— a  sentence  which  Bernard  would  never  have  written  had  he 
imagined  all  that  Olivier  read  into  it:  "In  the  same  room," 
he  repeated  to  himself — and  the  serpent  of  jealousy  unrolled 
its  abominable  coils  and  writhed  in  his  heart.  "They  sleep  in 
the  same  room!"  What  did  he  not  imagine?  His  mind  filled  with 
impure  visions  which  he  did  not  even  try  to  banish.  He  was 
not  jealous  in  particular  either  of  Edouard  or  of  Bernard;  but 
of  the  two.  He  pictured  each  of  them  in  turn  or  both  simulta- 


159  BERNARD  TO  OLIVIER 

neously,  and  at  the  same  time  envied  them.  He  received  the 
letter  one  forenoon.  "Ah!  so  that's  how  it  is.  .  .  ,"  he  kept 
saying  to  himself  all  the  rest  of  the  day.  That  night  the  fiends 
of  hell  inhabited  him.  Early  next  morning  he  rushed  ofi^  to 
Robert's.  The  Comte  de  Passavant  was  waiting  for  him.

EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:   LITTLE  BORIS 

I  HAVE  had  no  difficulty  in  finding  little  Boris.  The  day  after 
our  arrival,  he  appeared  on  the  hotel  terrace  and  began  looking 
at  the  mountains  through  a  telescope  which  stands  outside, 
mounted  on  a  swivel  for  the  use  of  the  tourists.  I  recognized 
him  at  once.  A  little  girl,  rather  older  than  Boris,  joined  him 
after  a  short  time.  I  was  sitting  near  by  in  the  drawing-room, 
of  which  the  French  window  was  standing  open,  and  I  did 
not  lose  a  word  of  their  conversation.  Though  I  wanted  very 
much  to  speak  to  him,  I  thought  it  more  prudent  to  wait  till 
I  could  make  the  acquaintance  of  the  little  girl's  mother — a 
Polish  woman  doctor,  who  is  in  charge  of  Boris  and  keeps  very 
careful  watch  over  him.  Little  Bronja  is  an  exquisite  creature; 
she  must  be  about  fifteen.  She  wears  her  fair  hair  in  two  thick 
plaits,  which  reach  to  her  waist;  the  expression  of  her  eyes  and 
the  sound  of  her  voice  are  more  angelic  than  human.  I  write 
down  the  two  children's  conversation: 

"Boris,  Mamma  had  rather  we  didn't  touch  the  telescope. 
Won't  you  come  for  a  walk?" 

"Yes,  I  will.  No,  I  won't." 

The  two  contradictory  sentences  were  uttered  in  the  same 
breath.  Bronja  only  answered  the  second: 

"Why  not?" 

"Because  it's  too  hot,  it's  too  cold."  He  had  come  away  from 
the  telescope. 

"Oh,  Boris,  do  be  nice!  You  know  Mamma  would  like  us  to 
go  out.  Where's  your  hat?" 

"Vibroskomenopatof.  Blaf  blaf." 

"What  does  that  mean?" 

"Nothing." 


161  LITTLE   BORIS 

"Then  why  do  you  say  it?" 

"So  that  you  shouldn't  understand." 

"If  it  doesn't  mean  anything,  it  doesn't  matter  about  not 
understanding  it." 

"But  if  it  did  mean  something,  anyhow  you  wouldn't  be  able 
to  understand." 

"When  one  talks  it's  in  order  to  be  understood." 

"Shall  we  play  at  making  words  in  order  to  understand 
them  only  us?" 

"First  of  all,  try  to  speak  good  grammar." 

"My  mamma  can  speak  French,  English,  Roumanian,  Turk- 
ish, Polish,  Italoscope,  Perroquese  and  Xixitou." 

All  this  was  said  very  fast,  in  a  kind  of  lyrical  ecstasy.  Bronja 
began  to  laugh. 

"Oh,  Boris,  why  are  you  always  saying  things  that  aren't 
true?" 

"Why  do  you  never  believe  what  I  say?" 

"I  believe  it  when  it's  true." 

"How  do  you  know  when  it's  true?  I  believed  you  the  other 
day  when  you  told  me  about  the  angels.  I  say,  Bronja,  do  you 
think  that,  if  I  were  to  pray  very  hard,  I  should  see  them 
too?" 

"Perhaps  you'll  see  them  if  you  get  out  of  the  habit  of  telling 
lies,  and  if  God  wants  to  show  them  to  you;  but  God  won't 
show  them  to  you  if  you  pray  to  him  only  for  that.  There  are 
heaps  of  beautiful  things  we  should  see  if  we  weren't  too 
naughty." 

"Bronja,  you  aren't  naughty;  that's  why  you  can  see  the 
angels.  I  shall  always  be  naughty." 

"Why  don't  you  try  not  to  be?  Shall  we  go  to — "  some 
place  whose  name  I  didn't  know — "and  pray  together  to  God 
and  the  Blessed  Virgin  to  help  you  not  to  be  naughty?" 

"Yes.  No;  listen — let's  take  a  stick;  you  shall  hold  one  end 
and  I  the  other.  I  will  shut  my  eyes,  and  I  promise  not  to 
open  them  until  we  get  to  the  place." 

They  walked  away,  and  as  they  were  going  down  the  terrace 
steps  I  heard  Boris  again: 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  162 

"Yes,  no,  not  that  end.  Wait  till  I've  wiped  it." 

"Why?" 

"I've  touched  it." 

Mme.  Sophroniska  came  up  to  me  as  I  was  sitting  alone, 
just  finishing  my  early  breakfast  and  wondering  how  I  could 
enter  into  conversation  with  her.  I  was  surprised  to  see  that 
she  was  holding  my  last  book  in  her  hand;  she  asked  me  with 
the  most  aff"able  smile  whether  it  was  the  author  whom  she 
had  the  pleasure  of  speaking  to;  then  she  immediately  launched 
upon  a  long  appreciation  of  my  book.  Her  judgment — both 
praise  and  criticism — seemed  to  me  more  intelligent  than  what 
I  am  accustomed  to  hearing,  though  her  point  of  view  is  any- 
thing but  literary.  She  told  me  she  was  almost  exclusively 
interested  in  questions  of  psychology  and  in  anything  that  may 
shed  a  new  light  on  the  human  soul.  "But  how  rare  it  is,"  she 
added,  "to  find  a  poet,  or  dramatist  or  novelist,  who  is  not 
satisfied  with  a  ready-made  psychology — "  the  only  kind,  I 
told  her,  that  satisfies  their  readers. 

Little  Boris  has  been  confided  to  her  for  the  holidays  by 
his  mother.  I  took  care  not  to  let  her  know  my  reasons  for 
being  interested  in  him. 

"He  is  very  delicate,"  said  Mme.  Sophroniska.  "His  mother's 
companionship  is  not  at  all  good  for  him.  She  wanted  to  come 
to  Saas-Fee  with  us,  but  I  would  only  consent  to  look  after  the 
child  on  condition  that  she  left  him  entirely  to  my  care;  other- 
wise it  would  be  impossible  to  answer  for  his  being  cured.  Just 
imagine,"  she  went  on,  "she  keeps  the  poor  little  thing  in  a 
state  of  continual  excitement — the  very  thing  to  develop  the 
worst  kind  of  nervous  troubles  in  him.  She  has  been  obliged 
to  earn  her  living  since  his  father's  death.  She  used  to  be  a 
pianist  and,  I  must  say,  a  marvellous  performer;  but  her  play- 
ing was  too  subtle  to  please  the  ordinary  public.  She  decided 
to  take  to  singing  at  concerts,  at  casinos — to  go  on  the  stage. 
She  used  to  take  Boris  with  her  to  her  dressing-room;  I  believe 
the  artificial  atmosphere  of  the  theatre  greatly  contributed  to 
upset  the  child's  balance.  His  mother  is  very  fond  of  him,  but  to 
tell  the  truth  it  is  most  desirable  that  he  shouldn't  live  with  her." 


163  LITTLE   BORIS 

"What  is  the  matter  with  him  exactly?"  I  asked. 

She  began  to  laugh: 

"Is  it  the  name  of  his  illness  you  want  to  know?  Oh,  you 
wouldn't  be  much  the  wiser  if  I  were  to  give  you  a  fine  scien- 
tific name  for  it." 

"Just  tell  me  what  he  suffers  from." 

"He  sufi'ers  from  a  number  of  little  troubles,  tics,  manias, 
which  are  the  sign  of  what  people  call  a  'nervous  child,'  and 
which  are  usually  treated  by  rest,  open  air  and  hygiene.  It 
is  certain  that  a  robust  organism  would  not  allow  these  dis- 
turbances to  show  themselves.  But  if  debility  favours  them, 
it  does  not  exactly  cause  them.  I  think  their  origin  can  always 
be  traced  to  some  early  shock,  brought  about  by  a  circumstance 
it  is  important  to  discover.  The  sufi"erer,  as  soon  as  he  becomes 
conscious  of  this  cause,  is  half  cured.  But  this  cause,  more  often 
than  not,  escapes  his  memory,  as  if  it  were  concealing  itself  in 
the  shadow  of  his  illness;  it  is  in  this  refuge  that  I  look  for 
it,  so  as  to  bring  it  out  into  the  daylight — into  the  field  of  vision, 
I  mean.  I  believe  that  the  look  of  a  clear-sighted  eye  cleanses 
the  mind,  as  a  ray  of  light  purifies  infected  water." 

I  repeated  to  Sophroniska  the  conversation  I  had  overheard 
the  day  before,  from  which  it  appeared  to  me  that  Boris  was 
very  far  from  being  cured. 

"It's  because  I  am  far  from  knowing  all  that  I  need  to  know 
of  Boris's  past.  It's  only  a  short  while  ago  that  I  began  my 
treatment." 

"Of  what  does  it  consist?" 

"Oh,  simply  in  letting  him  talk.  Every  day  I  spend  one  or 
two  hours  with  him.  I  question  him,  but  very  little.  The  im- 
portant thing  is  to  gain  his  confidence.  I  know  a  good  many 
things  already.  I  divine  a  good  many  others.  But  the  child  is 
still  on  the  defensive;  he  is  ashamed;  if  I  insisted  too  strongly, 
tried  to  force  his  confidence  too  quickly,  I  should  be  going 
against  the  very  thing  I  want  to  arrive  at — a  complete 
surrender.  It  would  set  his  back  up.  So  long  as  I  shall  not  have 
vanquished  his  reserve,  his  modesty  .  .  ." 

An  inquisition  of  this  kind  seemed  to  me  so  much  in  the 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  164 

nature  of  an  assault  that  it  was  with  difficulty  I  refrained  from 
protesting;  but  my  curiosity  carried  the  day. 

"Do  you  mean  that  you  expect  the  child  to  make  you  any 
shameful  revelations?" 

It  was  she  who  protested. 

"Oh,  shameful?  There's  no  more  shame  in  it  than  allowing 
oneself  to  be  sounded.  I  need  to  know  everything  and  partic- 
ularly what  is  most  carefully  hidden.  I  must  bring  Boris  to 
make  a  complete  confession;  until  I  can  do  that,  1  shall  not  be 
able  to  cure  him." 

"You  suspect  then  that  he  has  a  confession  to  make?  Are 
you  quite  sure — forgive  me — that  you  won't  yourself  suggest 
v/hat  you  want  him  to  confess?" 

"That  is  a  preoccupation  which  must  never  leave  me,  and  it  is 
for  that  reason  I  work  so  slowly.  I  have  seen  clumsy  magistrates 
who  have  unintentionally  prompted  a  child  to  give  evidence 
that  was  pure  invention  from  beginning  to  end,  and  the  child, 
under  the  pressure  of  the  magistrate's  examination,  tells  lies 
in  perfect  good  faith  and  makes  people  believe  in  entirely 
imaginary  misdeeds.  My  part  is  to  suggest  nothing.  Extraor- 
dinary patience  is  needed." 

"It  seems  to  me  that  in  such  cases  the  value  of  the  method 
depends  upon  the  value  of  the  operator." 

"I  shouldn't  have  dared  say  so.  I  assure  you  that  after  a 
little  practice  one  gets  extraordinarily  clever  at  it;  it's  a  kind 
of  divination — intuition,  if  you  prefer.  However,  one  sometimes 
goes  off  on  a  wrong  track;  the  important  thing  is  not  to  per- 
sist in  it.  Do  you  know  how  all  our  conversations  begin?  Boris 
starts  by  telling  me  what  he  has  dreamt  the  night  before." 

"How  do  you  know  he  doesn't  invent?" 

"And  even  if  he  did  invent!  ...  All  the  inventions  of  a 
diseased  imagination  reveal  something." 

She  was  silent  for  a  moment  or  two,  and  then :  "  'Invention' 
'diseased  imagination'  ...  no,  no,  that's  not  it.  Words  betray 
one's  meaning.  Boris  dreams  aloud  in  my  presence.  Every 
morning  he  consents  to  remain  during  one  hour  in  that  state 
of  semi-somnolence  in  which  the  images  which  present  them- 


165  LITTLE   BORIS 

selves  to  us  escape  from  the  control  of  our  reason.  They  no 
longer  group  and  associate  themselves  according  to  ordinary 
logic,  but  according  to  unforeseen  affinities;  above  all,  they  an- 
swer to  a  mysterious  inward  compulsion — which  is  the  very 
thing  I  want  to  discover;  and  the  ramblings  of  this  child  are  far 
more  instructive  than  the  most  intelligent  analysis  of  the  most 
conscious  of  minds  could  be.  Many  things  escape  the  reason, 
and  a  person  who  should  attempt  to  understand  life  by  merely 
using  his  reason  would  be  like  a  man  trying  to  take  hold  of  a 
flame  with  the  tongs.  Nothing  remains  but  a  bit  of  charred 
wood,  which  immediately  stops  flaming." 

She  was  again  silent  and  began  to  turn  over  the  pages  of  my 
book. 

"How  very  little  you  penetrate  into  the  human  soul!"  she 
cried;  then  she  laughed  and  added  abruptly: 

"Oh,  I  don't  mean  you  in  particular;  when  I  say  you,  I  mean 
novelists  in  general.  Most  of  your  characters  seem  to  be  built 
on  piles;  they  have  neither  foundations  nor  sub-soil.  I  really 
think  there's  more  truth  to  be  found  in  the  poets;  everything 
which  is  created  by  the  intelligence  alone  is  false.  But  now  I 
am  talking  of  what  isn't  my  business.  ...  Do  you  know  what 
puzzles  me  in  Boris?  I  believe  him  to  be  exceedingly  pure." 

"Why  should  that  puzzle  you?" 

"Because  1  don't  know  where  to  look  for  the  source  of  the 
evil.  Nine  times  out  of  ten  a  derangement  like  his  has  its  origin 
in  some  sort  of  ugly  secret." 

"Such  a  one  exists  in  every  one  of  us,  perhaps,"  said  I,  "but 
it  doesn't  make  us  all  ill,  thank  Heaven!" 

At  that  Mme.  Sophroniska  rose;  she  had  just  seen  Bronja 
pass  by  the  window. 

"Look!"  said  she,  pointing  her  out  to  me;  "there  is  Boris's 
real  doctor.  She  is  looking  for  me;  I  must  leave  you;  but  I 
shall  see  you  again,  shan't  I?" 

For  that  matter,  I  understand  what  Sophroniska  reproaches 
the  novel  for  not  giving  her;  but  in  this  case,  certain  reasons 
of  art  escape  her — higher  reasons,  which  make  me  think  that  a 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  166 

good  novelist  will  never  be  made  out  of  a  good  naturalist. 

I  have  introduced  Laura  to  Mme.  Sophroniska.  They  seem  to 
take  to  each  other,  and  I  am  glad  of  it.  I  have  fewer  scruples 
about  keeping  to  myself  when  1  know  they  are  chatting  to- 
gether. I  am  sorry  that  Bernard  has  no  companion  of  his  own 
age;  but  at  any  rate  the  preparation  for  his  examination  keeps 
him  occupied  for  several  hours  a  day,  I  have  been  able  to 
start  work  again  on  my  novel.

EDOUARD   EXPLAINS   HIS  THEORY 
OF   THE  NOVEL 

Notwithstanding  first  appearances,  and  though  each  of  them 
did  his  best,  Uncle  Edouard  and  Bernard  were  only  getting  on 
together  fairly  well.  Laura  was  not  feeling  satisfied,  either.  How 
should  she  be?  Circumstances  had  forced  her  to  assume  a  part 
for  which  she  was  not  fitted;  her  respectability  made  her  feel 
uncomfortable  in  it.  Like  those  loving  and  docile  creatures  who 
make  the  most  devoted  wives,  she  had  need  of  the  proprieties 
to  lean  on,  and  felt  herself  without  strength  now  that  she  was 
without  the  frame  of  her  proper  surroundings.  Her  situation 
as  regards  Edouard  seemed  to  her  more  and  more  false  every 
day.  What  she  suffered  from  most  and  what  she  found  un- 
endurable, if  she  let  her  mind  dwell  on  it,  was  the  thought 
that  she  was  living  at  the  expense  of  this  protector — or  rather 
that  she  was  giving  him  nothing  in  exchange — or  more  exactly, 
that  Edouard  asked  nothing  of  her  in  exchange,  while  she 
herself  felt  ready  to  give  him  everything.  "Benefits,"  says 
Tacitus,  through  the  mouth  of  Montaigne,  "are  only  agreeable 
as  long  as  one  can  repay  them";  no  doubt  this  is  only  true  of 
noble  souls,  but  without  question  Laura  was  one  of  these.  She, 
who  would  have  liked  to  give,  was  on  the  contrary  continually 
receiving,  and  this  irritated  her  against  Edouard.  Moreover 
when  she  went  over  the  past  in  her  mind,  it  seemed  to  her  that 
Edouard  had  deluded  her  by  awakening  a  love  in  her  which  she 
still  felt  strong  within  her  and  then  by  evading  this  love  and 
leaving  it  without  an  object.  Was  not  that  the  secret  motive 
of  her  errors — of  her  marriage  with  Douviers,  to  which  she  had 
resigned  herself,  to  which  Edouard  had  led  her — and  then  of 
her  yielding  so  soon  after  to  the  solicitations  of  the  springtime? 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  168 

For  she  must  needs  admit  it  to  herself,  in  Vincent's  arms  it 
was  still  Edouard  that  she  sought.  And  as  she  could  not  under- 
stand her  lover's  coldness,  she  accused  herself  of  being  respon- 
sible for  it,  and  imagined  that  she  might  have  vanquished  him, 
had  she  had  more  beauty  or  more  boldness;  and  as  she  could 
not  succeed  in  hating  him,  it  was  herself  she  upbraided  and 
depreciated,  denying  herself  all  value,  and  refusing  to  allow 
herself  any  reason  for  existing  or  the  possession  of  any  virtue. 

Let  us  add  further  that  this  camping-out  style  of  life,  neces- 
sitated by  the  arrangement  of  the  rooms,  though  it  might  seem 
amusing  to  her  companions,  hurt  her  delicacy  in  many  sensitive 
places.  And  she  could  see  no  issue  to  the  situation,  which  yet 
was  one  it  would  be  difficult  to  prolong. 

The  only  scrap  of  comfort  and  joy  Laura  was  able  to  find  in 
her  present  life,  was  by  inventing  for  herself  the  duties  of  god- 
mother or  elder  sister  towards  Bernard.  The  worship  of  a  youth 
so  charming  touched  her;  the  adoration  he  paid  her  prevented 
her  from  slipping  down  that  slope  of  self-contempt  and  loathing 
which  may  lead  even  the  most  irresolute  creature  to  the  ex- 
tremest  resolutions.  Bernard,  every  morning  that  he  was  not 
called  ofi'  before  daybreak  by  an  expedition  into  the  mountains 
(for  he  loved  early  rising),  used  to  spend  two  good  hours  with 
her  reading  English.  The  examination  he  was  going  up  for  in 
October  was  a  convenient  excuse. 

It  cannot  be  said  that  his  secretarial  duties  took  up  much  of 
his  time.  They  were  ill-defined.  When  Bernard  undertook  them 
he  imagined  himself  already  seated  at  a  desk,  writing  from 
Edouard's  dictation,  or  copying  out  his  manuscripts.  Now  Ed- 
ouard never  dictated,  and  his  manuscripts,  such  as  they  were, 
remained  at  the  bottom  of  his  trunk;  Bernard  was  free  every 
hour  of  the  day;  but  it  only  lay  with  Edouard  to  make  more 
calls  upon  Bernard,  v/ho  was  most  anxious  to  have  his  zeal 
made  use  of,  so  that  Bernard  was  not  particularly  distressed 
by  his  want  of  occupation,  or  by  the  feeling  that  he  was  not 
earning  his  living — which,  thanks  to  Edouard's  munificence, 
was  a  very  comfortable  one.  He  was  quite  determined  not  to 
let  himself  be  embarrassed  by  scruples.  He  believed,  I  dare  not 


169  THEORY  OF   THE   NOVEL 

say  in  Providence,  but  at  any  rate  in  his  star,  and  that  a  certain 
amount  of  happiness  was  due  to  him,  as  the  air  is  to  the  lungs 
which  breathe  it;  Edouard  was  its  dispenser  in  the  same  way 
as  the  sacred  orator,  according  to  Bossuet,  is  the  dispenser  of 
divine  wisdom.  Moreover  Bernard  considered  the  present  state 
of  affairs  as  merely  temporary,  and  was  convinced  that  some 
day  he  would  be  able  to  acquit  his  debt,  as  soon  as  he  could 
bring  to  the  mint  the  uncoined  riches  whose  abundance  he 
felt  in  his  heart.  What  vexed  him  more  was  that  Edouard  made 
no  demand  upon  certain  gifts  which  he  felt  within  himself  and 
which  it  seemed  to  him  Edouard  lacked.  "He  doesn't  know  how 
to  make  use  of  me,"  thought  Bernard,  who  thereupon  checked 
his  self-conceit  and  wisely  added:  "Worse  luck!" 

But  then  what  was  the  reason  of  this  uncomfortable  feeling 
between  Edouard  and  Bernard?  Bernard  seems  to  me  to  be 
one  of  those  people  who  find  their  self-assurance  in  opposition. 
He  could  not  endure  that  Edouard  should  have  any  ascendancy 
over  him  and,  rather  than  yield  to  his  influence,  rebelled  against 
it.  Edouard,  who  never  dreamed  of  coercing  him,  was  alter- 
nately vexed  and  grieved  to  feel  him  so  restive  and  so  con- 
stantly on  the  alert  to  defend — or,  at  any  rate,  to  protect — 
himself.  He  came  to  the  pitch  of  doubting  whether  he  had  not 
committed  an  act  of  folly  in  taking  away  with  him  these  two 
beings,  whom  he  seemed  only  to  have  united  in  order  that  they 
should  league  together  against  him.  Incapable  of  penetrating 
Laura's  secret  sentiments,  he  took  her  reserve  and  her  reticence 
for  coldness.  It  would  have  made  him  exceedingly  uncom- 
fortable if  he  had  been  able  to  see  more  clearly;  and  Laura 
understood  this;  so  that  her  unrequited  love  spent  all  its 
strength  in  keeping  hidden  and  silent. 

Tea-time  found  them  as  a  rule  all  assembled  in  the  big  sit- 
ting-room; it  often  happened  that,  at  their  invitation,  Mme. 
Sophroniska  joined  them,  generally  on  the  days  when  Boris  and 
Bronja  were  out  walking.  She  left  them  very  free  in  spite  of 
their  youthfulness;  she  had  perfect  confidence  in  Bronja  and 
knew  that  she  was  very  prudent,  especially  with  Boris,  who  was 
always  particularly  amenable  with  her.  The  country  was  quite 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  170 

safe;  for  of  course  there  was  no  question  of  their  adventuring 
on  to  the  mountains,  or  even  of  their  climbing  the  rocks  near 
the  hotel.  One  day  when  the  two  children  had  obtained  leave 
to  go  to  the  foot  of  the  glacier,  on  condition  they  did  not  leave 
the  road,  Mme.  Sophroniska,  who  had  been  invited  to  tea,  was 
emboldened,  with  Bernard's  and  Laura's  encouragement,  to  beg 
Edouard  to  tell  them  about  his  next  novel — that  is,  if  he  had 
no  objection. 

"None  at  all;  but  I  can't  tell  you  its  story." 

And  yet  he  seemed  almost  to  lose  his  temper  when  Laura 
asked  him  (evidently  a  tactless  question)  what  the  book  would 
be  like? 

"Nothing!"  he  exclaimed;  then,  immediately  and  as  if  he 
had  only  been  waiting  for  this  provocation:  "What  is  the  use 
of  doing  over  again  what  other  people  have  done  already,  or 
what  I  myself  have  done  already,  or  what  other  people 
might  do?" 

Edouard  had  no  sooner  uttered  these  words  than  he  felt  how 
improper,  how  outrageous  and  how  absurd  they  were;  at  any 
rate  they  seemed  to  him  improper  and  absurd;  or  he  was  afraid 
that  this  was  how  they  would  strike  Bernard. 

Edouard  was  very  sensitive.  As  soon  as  he  began  talking  of 
his  work,  and  especially  when  other  people  made  him  talk  of 
it,  he  seemed  to  lose  his  head. 

He  had  the  most  perfect  contempt  for  the  usual  fatuity  of 
authors;  he  snuffed  out  his  own  as  well  as  he  could;  but  he  was 
not  unwilling  to  seek  a  reinforcement  of  his  modesty  in  other 
people's  consideration;  if  this  consideration  failed  him,  modesty 
immediately  went  by  the  board.  He  attached  extreme  impor- 
tance to  Bernard's  esteem.  Was  it  with  a  view  to  conquering 
this  that,  when  Bernard  was  with  him,  he  set  his  Pegasus 
prancing?  It  was  the  worst  way  possible.  Edouard  knew  it;  he 
said  so  to  himself  over  and  over  again;  but  in  spite  of  all  his 
resolutions,  as  soon  as  he  was  in  Bernard's  company,  he  behaved 
quite  differently  from  what  he  wished,  and  spoke  in  a  manner 
which  immediately  appeared  absurd  to  him  (and  which  indeed 
was  so).  This  might  almost  make  one  suppose  that  he  loved 


171  THEORY  OF  THE  NOVEL 

Bernard?  ...  No;  I  think  not.  But  a  little  vanity  is  quite  as 
effectual  in  making  us  pose  as  a  great  deal  of  love. 

"Is  it  because  the  novel,  of  all  literary  genres,  is  the  freest,  the 
most  lawless,"  held  forth  Edouard,  ".  .  .  is  it  for  that  very 
reason,  for  fear  of  that  very  liberty  (the  artists  who  are  always 
sighing  after  liberty  are  often  the  most  bewildered  when  they 
get  it),  that  the  novel  has  always  clung  to  reality  with  such 
timidity?  And  I  am  not  speaking  only  of  the  French  novel.  It 
is  the  same  with  the  English  novel;  and  the  Russian  novel,  for 
all  its  throwing  off  of  constraints,  is  a  slave  to  resemblance.  The 
only  progress  it  looks  to  is  to  get  still  nearer  to  nature.  The 
novel  has  never  known  that  'formidable  erosion  of  contours,' 
as  Nietzsche  calls  it;  that  deliberate  avoidance  of  life,  which 
gave  style  to  the  works  of  the  Greek  dramatists,  for  instance, 
or  to  the  tragedies  of  the  French  XVI  Ith  century.  Is  there  any- 
thing more  perfectly  and  deeply  human  than  these  works?  But 
that's  just  it — they  are  human  only  in  their  depths;  they  don't 
pride  themselves  on  appearing  so — or,  at  any  rate,  on  appearing 
real.  They  remain  works  of  art." 

Edouard  had  got  up,  and,  for  fear  of  seeming  to  give  a  lec- 
ture, began  to  pour  out  the  tea  as  he  spoke;  then  he  moved  up 
and  down,  then  squeezed  a  lemon  into  his  cup,  but,  nevertheless, 
continued  speaking: 

"Because  Balzac  was  a  genius,  and  because  every  genius  seems 
to  bring  to  his  art  a  final  and  conclusive  solution,  it  has  been 
decreed  that  the  proper  function  of  the  novel  is  to  rival  the 
etat-civil}  Balzac  constructed  his  work;  he  never  claimed  to 
codify  the  novel;  his  article  on  Stendhal  proves  it.  Rival  the 
etat-civil!  As  if  there  weren't  enough  fools  and  boors  in  the 
world  as  it  is!  What  have  I  to  do  with  the  etat-civil?  L'etat  c'est 
moi!  I,  the  artist;  civil  or  not,  my  work  doesn't  pretend  to 
rival  anything." 

Edouard,  who  was  getting  excited — a  little  factitiously,  per- 
haps— sat  down.  He  affected  not  to  look  at  Bernard;  but  it 
was  for  him  that  he  was  speaking.  If  he  had  been  alone  with 

iThe  state  records  of  each  individual  citizen,  in  which  are  noted  the 
legal  facts  of  his  existence. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  172 

him,  he  would  not  have  been  able  to  say  a  word;  he  was  grateful 
to  the  two  women  for  setting  him  on. 

"Sometimes  it  seems  to  me  there  is  nothing  in  all  literature 
I  admire  so  much  as,  for  instance,  the  discussion  between  Mith- 
ridate  and  his  two  sons  in  Racine;  it's  a  scene  in  which  the 
characters  speak  in  a  way  we  know  perfectly  well  no  father  and 
no  sons  could  ever  have  spoken  in,  and  yet  (1  ought  to  say  for 
that  very  reason)  it's  a  scene  in  which  all  fathers  and  all  sons 
can  see  themselves.  By  localizing  and  specifying  one  restricts.  It 
is  true  that  there  is  no  psychological  truth  unless  it  be  particu- 
lar; but  on  the  other  hand  there  is  no  art  unless  it  be  general. 
The  whole  problem  lies  just  in  that — how  to  express  the  general 
by  the  particular — how  to  make  the  particular  express  the 
general.  May  I  light  my  pipe?" 

"Do,  do,"  said  Sophroniska. 

"Well,  I  should  like  a  novel  which  should  be  at  the  same 
time  as  true  and  as  far  from  reality,  as  particular  and  at  the 
same  time  as  general,  as  human  and  as  fictitious  as  Athalie,  or 
Tartufje  or  Cinna." 

"And  ...  the  subject  of  this  novel?" 

"It  hasn't  got  one,"  answered  Edouard  brusquely,  "and  per- 
haps that's  the  most  astonishing  thing  about  it.  My  novel 
hasn't  got  a  subject.  Yes,  I  know,  it  sounds  stupid.  Let's  say,  if 
you  prefer  it,  it  hasn't  got  one  subject  ...  'a  slice  of  life,'  the 
naturalist  school  said.  The  great  defect  of  that  school  is  that 
it  always  cuts  its  slice  in  the  same  direction;  in  time,  length- 
wise. Why  not  in  breadth?  Or  in  depth?  As  for  me  I  should 
like  not  to  cut  at  all.  Please  understand;  I  should  like  to  put 
everything  into  my  novel.  I  don't  want  any  cut  of  the  scissors 
to  limit  its  substance  at  one  point  rather  than  at  another.  For 
more  than  a  year  now  that  I  have  been  working  at  it,  nothing 
happens  to  me  that  I  don't  put  into  it — everything  I  see,  every- 
thing I  know,  everything  that  other  people's  lives  and  my  own 
teach  me.  .  .  ." 

"And  the  whole  thing  stylized  into  art?"  said  Sophroniska, 
feigning  the  most  lively  attention,  but  no  doubt  a  little  ironi- 


173  THEORY  OF  THE  NOVEL 

cally.  Laura  could  not  suppress  a  smile.  Edouard  shrugged  his 
shoulders  slightly  and  went  on: 

"And  even  that  isn't  what  I  want  to  do.  What  I  want  is  to 
represent  reality  on  the  one  hand,  and  on  the  other  that  effort 
to  stylize  it  into  art  of  which  I  have  just  been  speaking." 

"My  poor  dear  friend,  you  will  make  your  readers  die  of 
boredom,"  said  Laura;  as  she  could  no  longer  hide  her  smile, 
she  had  made  up  her  mind  to  laugh  outright. 

"Not  at  all.  In  order  to  arrive  at  this  effect — do  you  follow 
me? — I  invent  the  character  of  a  novelist,  whom  I  make  my 
central  figure;  and  the  subject  of  the  book,  if  you  must  have 
one,  is  just  that  very  struggle  between  what  reality  offers  him 
and  what  he  himself  desires  to  make  of  it." 

"Yes,  yes;  I'm  beginning  to  see,"  said  Sophroniska  politely, 
though  Laura's  laugh  was  very  near  conquering  her.  "But  you 
know  it's  always  dangerous  to  represent  intellectuals  in  novels. 
The  public  is  bored  by  them;  one  only  manages  to  make  them 
say  absurdities  and  they  give  an  air  of  abstraction  to  every- 
thing they  touch." 

"And  then  I  see  exactly  what  will  happen,"  cried  Laura;  "in 
this  novelist  of  yours  you  won't  be  able  to  help  painting 
yourself." 

She  had  lately  adopted  in  talking  to  Edouard  a  jeering  tone 
which  astonished  herself  and  upset  Edouard  all  the  more  that 
he  saw  a  reflection  of  it  in  Bernard's  mocking  eyes.  Edouard 
protested : 

"No,  no.  I  shall  take  care  to  make  him  very  disagreeable." 

Laura  was  fairly  started. 

"That's  just  it;  everybody  will  recognize  you,"  she  said, 
bursting  into  such  hearty  laughter  that  the  others  were  caught 
by  its  infection. 

"And  is  the  plan  of  the  book  made  up?"  enquired  Sophro- 
niska, trying  to  regain  her  seriousness. 

"Of  course  not." 

"What  do  you  mean?  Of  course  not!" 

"You  ought  to  understand  that  it's  essentially  out  of  the 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  174 

question  for  a  book  of  this  kind  to  have  a  plan.  Everything 
would  be  falsified  if  anything  were  settled  beforehand.  I  wait 
for  reality  to  dictate  to  me." 

"But  I  thought  you  wanted  to  abandon  reality." 

"My  novelist  wants  to  abandon  it;  but  I  shall  continually 
bring  him  back  to  it.  In  fact  that  will  be  the  subject;  the  strug- 
gle between  the  facts  presented  by  reality  and  the  ideal  reality." 

The  illogical  nature  of  his  remarks  was  flagrant — painfully 
obvious  to  everyone.  It  was  clear  that  Edouard  housed  in  his 
brain  two  incompatible  requirements  and  that  he  was  wearing 
himself  out  in  the  desire  to  reconcile  them. 

"Have  you  got  on  far  with  it?"  asked  Sophroniska  politely. 

"It  depends  on  what  you  mean  by  far.  To  tell  the  truth,  of 
the  actual  book  not  a  line  has  been  written.  But  I  have  worked 
at  it  a  great  deal.  1  think  of  it  every  day  and  incessantly.  I 
work  at  it  in  a  very  odd  manner,  as  I'll  tell  you.  Day  by  day 
in  a  note-book,  I  note  the  state  of  the  novel  in  my  mind;  yes, 
it's  a  kind  of  diary  that  I  keep  as  one  might  do  of  a  child.  .  .  . 
That  is  to  say,  that  instead  of  contenting  myself  with  resolving 
each  difficulty  as  it  presents  itself  (and  every  work  of  art  is 
only  the  sum  or  the  product  of  the  solutions  of  a  quantity  of 
small  difficulties),  I  set  forth  each  of  these  difficulties  and  study 
it.  My  note-book  contains,  as  it  were,  a  running  criticism  of  my 
novel — or  rather  of  the  novel  in  general.  Just  think  how  inter- 
esting such  a  note-book  kept  by  Dickens  or  Balzac  would  be; 
if  we  had  the  diary  of  the  Education  Sentimentale  or  of  The 
Brothers  Karamaiofl — the  story  of  the  work — of  its  gestation! 
How  thrilling  it  would  be  .  .  .  more  interesting  than  the  work 
itself.  .  .  ." 

Edouard  vaguely  hoped  that  someone  would  ask  him  to 
read  these  notes.  But  not  one  of  the  three  showed  the  slightest 
curiosity.  Instead: 

"My  poor  friend,"  said  Laura,  with  a  touch  of  sadness,  "it's 
quite  clear  that  you'll  never  write  this  novel  of  yours." 

"Well,  let  me  tell  you,"  cried  Edouard  impetuously,  "that  I 
don't  care.  Yes,  if  I  don't  succeed  in  writing  the  book,  it'll  be 
because  the  history  of  the  book  will  have  interested  me  more 


175  THEORY  OF  THE   NOVEL 

than  the  book  itself — taken  the  book's  place;  and  it'll  be  a  very- 
good  thing." 

"Aren't  you  afraid,  when  you  abandon  reality  in  this  way,  of 
losing  yourself  in  regions  of  deadly  abstraction  and  of  making 
a  novel  about  ideas  instead  of  about  human  beings?"  asked 
Sophroniska  kindly. 

"And  even  so!"  cried  Edouard  with  redoubled  energy.  "Must 
we  condemn  the  novel  of  ideas  because  of  the  groping  and 
stumbling  of  the  incapable  people  who  have  tried  their  hands 
at  it?  Up  till  now  we  have  been  given  nothing  but  novels  with 
a  purpose  parading  as  novels  of  ideas.  But  that's  not  it  at  all, 
as  you  may  imagine.  Ideas  .  .  .  ideas,  I  must  confess,  interest 
me  more  than  men — interest  me  more  than  anything.  They  live; 
they  fight;  they  perish  like  men.  Of  course  it  may  be  said  that 
our  only  knowledge  of  them  is  through  men,  just  as  our  only 
knowledge  of  the  wind  is  through  the  reeds  that  it  bends;  but 
all  the  same  the  wind  is  of  more  importance  than  the  reeds." 

"The  wind  exists  independently  of  the  reed,"  ventured  Ber- 
nard. His  intervention  made  Edouard,  who  had  long  been 
waiting  for  it,  start  afresh  with  renewed  spirit: 

"Yes,  I  know;  ideas  exist  only  because  of  men;  but  that's 
what's  so  pathetic;  they  live  at  their  expense." 

Bernard  had  listened  to  all  this  with  great  attention;  he 
was  full  of  scepticism  and  very  near  taking  Edouard  for  a  mere 
dreamer;  but  during  the  last  few  moments  he  had  been  touched 
by  his  eloquence  and  had  felt  his  mind  waver  in  its  breath; 
"But,"  thought  Bernard,  "the  reed  lifts  its  head  again  as  soon 
as  the  wind  has  passed."  He  remembered  what  he  had  been 
taught  at  school — that  man  is  swayed  by  his  passions  and  not 
by  ideas.  In  the  mean  time  Edouard  was  going  on: 

"What  I  should  like  to  do  is  something  like  the  art  of  fugue 
writing.  And  I  can't  see  why  what  was  possible  in  music  should 
be  impossible  in  literature.  .  .  ." 

To  which  Sophroniska  rejoined  that  music  is  a  mathematical 
art,  and  moreover  that  Bach,  by  dealing  only  with  figures  and 
by  banishing  all  pathos  and  all  humanity,  had  achieved  an 
abstract  chef  d'oeuvre  of  boredom,   a   kind  of  astronomical 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  176 

temple,  open  only  to  the  few  rare  initiated  Edouard  at  once 
protested  that,  for  his  part,  he  thought  the  temple  admirable, 
and  considered  it  the  apex  and  crowning  point  of  all  Bach's 
career. 

"After  which,"  added  Laura,  "people  were  cured  of  the  fugue 
for  a  long  time  to  come.  Human  emotion,  when  it  could  no 
longer  inhabit  it,  sought  a  dwelling  place  elsewhere." 

The  discussion  tailed  off  in  an  unprofitable  argument.  Ber- 
nard, who  until  then  had  kept  silent,  but  who  was  beginning  to 
fidget  on  his  chair,  at  last  could  bear  it  no  longer;  with  ex- 
treme, even  exaggerated  deference,  as  was  his  habit  whenever 
he  spoke  to  Edouard,  but  with  a  kind  of  sprightliness,  which 
seemed  to  make  a  jest  of  his  deference : 

"Forgive  me,  sir,"  said  he,  "for  knowing  the  title  of  your 
book,  since  I  learnt  it  through  my  own  indiscretion — which 
however  you  have  been  kind  enough  to  pass  over.  But  the  title 
seemed  to  me  to  announce  a  story." 

"Oh,  tell  us  what  the  title  is!"  said  Laura. 

"Certainly,  my  dear  Laura,  if  you  wish  it.  .  .  .  But  I  warn 
you  that  I  may  possibly  change  it.  I  am  afraid  it's  rather  de- 
ceptive. .  .  .  Well,  tell  it  them,  Bernard." 

"May  I?  .  .  .  The  Counterfeiters,"  said  Bernard.  "But  now 
you  tell  us — who  are  these  Counterfeiters?" 

"Oh  dear!  I  don't  know,"  said  Edouard. 

Bernard  and  Laura  looked  at  each  other  and  then  looked  at 
Sophroniska.  There  was  a  long  sigh;  I  think  it  was  drawn  by 
Laura. 

In  reality,  Edouard  had  in  the  first  place  been  thinking  of 
certain  of  his  fellow  novelists  when  he  began  to  think  of  The 
'Counterfeiters,  and  in  particular  of  the  Comte  de  Passavant. 
But  this  attribution  had  been  considerably  widened;  according 
as  the  wind  blew  from  Rome  or  from  elsewhere,  his  heroes  be- 
came in  turn  either  priests  or  free-masons.  If  he  allowed  his 
mind  to  follow  its  bent,  it  soon  tumbled  headlong  into  abstrac- 
tions, where  it  was  as  comfortable  as  a  fish  in  water.  Ideas  of 
exchange,  of  depreciation,  of  inflation,  etc.,  gradually  invaded 
his  book  (like  the  theory  of  clothes  in  Carlyle's  Sartor  Resartus) 


177  THEORY  OF  THE  NOVEL 

and  usurped  the  place  of  the  characters.  As  it  was  impossible 
for  Edouard  to  speak  of  this,  he  kept  silent  in  the  most  awk- 
ward manner,  and  his  silence,  which  seeemed  like  an  admis- 
sion of  penury,  began  to  make  the  other  three  very  uncom- 
fortable. 

"Has  it  ever  happened  to  you  to  hold  a  counterfeit  coin  in 
your  hands?"  he  asked  at  last. 

"Yes,"  said  Bernard;  but  the  two  women's  "No"  drowned 
his  voice. 

"Well,  imagine  a  false  ten-franc  gold  piece.  In  reality  it's  not 
worth  two  sous.  But  it  will  be  worth  ten  francs  as  long  as  no 
one  recognizes  it  to  be  false.  So  if  I  start  from  the  idea 
that  .  .  ." 

"But  why  start  from  an  idea?"  interrupted  Bernard  impa- 
tiently. "If  you  were  to  start  from  a  fact  and  make  a  good  ex- 
position of  it,  the  idea  would  come  of  its  own  accord  to  inhabit 
it.  If  I  were  writing  The  Counterfeiters  I  should  begin  by  show- 
ing the  counterfeit  coin — the  little  ten-franc  piece  you  were 
speaking  of  just  now." 

So  saying,  he  pulled  out  of  his  pocket  a  small  coin,  which  he 
flung  on  to  the  table. 

"Just  hear  how  true  it  rings.  Almost  the  same  sound  as  the 
real  one.  One  would  swear  it  was  gold.  I  was  taken  in  by  it 
this  morning,  just  as  the  grocer  who  passed  it  on  to  me  had 
been  taken  in  himself,  he  told  me.  It  isn't  quite  the  same  weight, 
I  think;  but  it  has  the  brightness  and  the  sound  of  a  real  piece; 
it  is  coated  with  gold,  so  that,  all  the  same,  it  is  worth  a  little 
more  than  two  sous;  but  it's  made  of  glass.  It'll  wear  trans- 
parent. No;  don't  rub  it;  you'll  spoil  it.  One  can  almost  see 
through  it,  as  it  is." 

Edouard  had  seized  it  and  was  considering  it  with  the  utmost 
curiosity. 

"But  where  did  the  grocer  get  it  from?" 

"He  didn't  know.  He  thinks  he  has  had  it  in  his  drawer  some 
days.  He  amused  himself  by  passing  it  off  on  me  to  see  whether 
I  should  be  taken  in.  Upon  my  word,  I  was  just  going  to  accept 
it!  But  as  he's  an  honest  man,  he  undeceived  me;  then  he  let 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  178 

me  have  it  for  five  francs.  He  wanted  to  l<eep  it  to  show  to 
what  he  calls  'amateurs.'  I  thought  there  couldn't  be  a  better 
one  than  the  author  of  The  Counterfeiters;  and  it  was  to  show 
you  that  I  took  it.  But  now  that  you  have  examined  it,  give  it 
back  to  me!  I'm  sorry  that  the  reality  doesn't  interest  you." 

"Yes,  it  does";  said  Edouard,  "but  it  disturbs  me  too." 

"That's  a  pity,"  rejoined  Bernard. 

EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL 

Tuesday  evening. — Sophroniska,  Bernard  and  Laura  have  been 
questioning  me  about  my  novel.  Why  did  I  let  myself  go  to 
speak  of  it?  I  said  nothing  but  stupidities.  Interrupted  fortu- 
nately by  the  return  of  the  two  children.  They  were  red  and  out 
of  breath,  as  if  they  had  been  running.  As  soon  as  she  came  in, 
Bronja  fell  into  her  mother's  arms;  I  thought  she  was  going  to 
burst  into  sobs. 

"Mamma!"  she  cried,  "do  scold  Boris.  He  wanted  to  undress 
and  lie  down  in  the  snow  without  any  clothes  on." 

Sophroniska  looked  at  Boris,  who  was  standing  in  the  door- 
way, his  head  down,  his  eyes  with  a  look  in  them  of  almost 
hatred;  she  seemed  not  to  notice  the  little  boy's  strange  ex- 
pression, but  with  admirable  calm: 

"Listen,  Boris,"  she  said.  "That's  a  thing  you  mustn't  do  in 
the  evening.  If  you  like  we'll  go  there  to-morrow  morning;  first 
of  all  you  must  begin  with  bare  feet  .  .  ." 

She  was  gently  stroking  her  daughter's  forehead;  but  the 
little  girl  suddenly  fell  on  the  ground  and  began  rolling  about 
in  convulsions.  It  was  rather  alarming.  Sophroniska  lifted  her 
and  laid  her  on  the  sofa.  Boris  stood  motionless,  watching  the 
scene  with  a  dazed,  bewildered  expression. 

Sophroniska's  methods  of  education  seem  to  me  excellent  in 
theory,  but  perhaps  she  miscalculates  the  children's  powers  of 
resistance. 

"You  behave,"  said  I,  when  I  was  alone  with  her  a  little  later 
(after  the  evening  meal  I  had  gone  to  enquire  after  Bronja, 


179  THEORY  OF  THE   NOVEL 

who  was  too  unwell  to  come  downstairs),  "as  if  good  were  al- 
ways sure  to  triumph  over  evil." 

"It  is  true,"  she  said,  "I  firmly  believe  that  good  must 
triumph.  I  have  confidence." 

"And  yet,  through  excess  of  confidence  you  might  make  a 
mistake.  .  .  ." 

"Every  time  I  have  made  a  mistake,  it  has  been  because  my 
confidence  was  not  great  enough.  To-day,  when  I  allowed  the 
children  to  go  out,  I  couldn't  help  showing  them  1  was  a  little 
uneasy.  They  felt  it.  All  the  rest  followed  from  that." 

She  had  taken  my  hand. 

"You  don't  seem  to  believe  in  the  virtue  of  convictions.  .  .  . 
I  mean  in  their  power  as  an  active  principle." 

"You  are  right,"  I  said  laughing.  "I  am  not  a  mystic." 

"Well,  as  for  me,"  she  cried  in  an  admirable  burst  of  en- 
thusiasm, "I  believe  with  my  whole  soul  that  without  mysticism 
nothing  great,  nothing  fine  can  be  accomplished  in  this  world." 

Discovered  the  name  of  Victor  Strouvilhou  in  the  visitors' 
book.  From  what  the  hotel-keeper  says,  he  must  have  left  Saas- 
Fee  two  days  before  our  arrival,  after  staying  here  nearly  a 
month.  I  should  have  been  curious  to  see  him  again.  No  doubt 
Sophroniska  talked  to  him.  I  must  ask  her  about  him. 


IV 

BERNARD  AND   LAURA 

"I  WANTED  to  ask  you,  Laura,"  said  Bernard,  "whether  you 
think  there  exists  anything  in  this  world  that  mayn't  become  a 
subject  of  doubt.  ...  So  much  so,  that  I  wonder  whether  one 
couldn't  take  doubt  itself  as  a  starting  point;  for  that,  at  any 
rate,  will  never  fail  us.  I  may  doubt  the  reality  of  everything, 
but  not  the  reality  of  my  doubt,  I  should  like  ,  .  .  Forgive  me 
if  I  express  myself  pedantically — I  am  not  pedantic  by  nature, 
but  I  have  just  left  the  lycee,  and  you  have  no  idea  what  a 
stamp  is  impressed  on  the  mind  by  the  philosophical  training 
of  our  last  year;  I  will  get  rid  of  it  I  promise  you." 

"Why  this  parenthesis?  You  would  like  .  .  .  ?" 

"I  should  like  to  write  a  story  of  a  person  who  starts  by  lis- 
tening to  everyone,  who  consults  everyone  like  Panurge,  be- 
fore deciding  to  do  anything;  after  having  discovered  that  the 
opinions  of  all  these  people  are  contradictory  in  every  point, 
he  makes  up  his  mind  to  consult  no  one  but  himself,  and 
thereupon  becomes  a  person  of  great  capacity." 

"It's  the  idea  of  an  old  man,"  said  Laura. 

"I  am  more  mature  than  you  think.  A  few  days  ago  I  began 
to  keep  a  note-book,  like  Edouard;  I  write  down  an  opinion  on 
the  right  hand  page,  whenever  I  can  write  the  opposite  opinion, 
facing  it,  on  the  left  hand  page.  For  instance,  the  other  evening 
Sophroniska  told  us  that  she  made  Bronja  and  Boris  sleep  with 
their  windows  open.  Everything  she  said  in  support  of  this 
regime  seemed  to  us  perfectly  reasonable  and  convincing,  didn't 
it?  Well,  yesterday  in  the  smoking-room,  I  heard  that  German 
professor  who  has  just  arrived  maintain  the  contrary  theory, 
which  seemed  to  me,  I  must  admit,  more  reasonable  still  and 
better  grounded.  The  important  thing  during  sleep,  said  he,  is 


181  BERNARD  AND  LAURA 

to  restrict  as  much  as  possible  all  expenditure  and  the  traffic  of 
exchanges  in  which  life  consists — carburation,  he  called  it;  it  is 
only  then  that  sleep  becomes  really  restorative.  He  gave  as  ex- 
ample the  birds  who  sleep  with  their  heads  under  their  wings, 
and  the  animals  who  snuggle  down  when  they  go  to  sleep,  so  as 
to  be  hardly  able  to  breathe  at  all;  in  the  same  way,  he  said, 
the  races  that  are  nearest  to  nature,  the  peasants  who  are  least 
cultivated,  stuff  themselves  up  at  night  in  little  closets;  and 
Arabs,  who  are  forced  to  sleep  in  the  open,  at  any  rate  cover 
their  faces  up  with  the  hood  of  their  burnous.  But  to  return  to 
Sophroniska  and  the  two  children  she  is  bringing  up,  I  come 
round  to  thinking  she  is  not  wrong  after  all,  and  that  what  is 
good  for  others  would  be  harmful  for  these  two,  because,  if  I 
understand  rightly,  they  have  the  germs  of  tubercle  in  them.  In 
short,  I  said  to  myself  .  .  .  But  I'm  boring  you." 

"Never  mind  about  that.  You  said  to  yourself  .  .  .  ?" 

"I've  forgotten." 

"Now,  now,  that's  naughty.  You  mustn't  be  ashamed  of  your 
thoughts." 

"I  said  to  myself  that  nothing  is  good  for  everyone,  but  only 
relatively  to  some  people;  that  nothing  is  true  for  everyone,  but 
only  relatively  to  the  person  who  believes  it  is;  that  there  is  no 
method  and  no  theory  which  can  be  applied  indifferently  to  all 
alike;  that  if,  in  order  to  act,  we  must  make  a  choice,  at  any 
rate  we  are  free  to  choose;  and  that  if  we  aren't  free  to  choose, 
the  thing  is  simpler  still;  the  belief  that  becomes  truth  for  me 
(not  absolutely,  no  doubt,  but  relatively  to  me)  is  that  which 
allows  me  the  best  use  of  my  strength,  the  best  means  of  putting 
my  virtues  into  action.  For  I  can't  prevent  myself  from  doubt- 
ing, and  at  the  same  time  I  loathe  indecision.  The  soft  and 
comfortable  pillow  Montaigne  talks  of,  is  not  for  my  head,  for 
I'm  not  sleepy  yet  and  I  don't  want  to  rest.  It's  a  long  way  that 
leads  from  what  I  thought  I  was  to  what  perhaps  I  really  am. 
I  am  afraid  sometimes  that  I  got  up  too  early  in  the  morning." 

"Afraid?" 

"No;  I'm  afraid  of  nothing.  But,  d'you  know,  I  have  already 
changed  a  great  deal;  that  is,  my  mind's  landscape  is  not  at  all 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  182 

what  it  was  the  day  I  left  home;  since  then  I  have  met  you.  As 
soon  as  1  did  that  1  stopped  putting  my  freedom  first.  Perhaps 
you  haven't  realized  that  1  am  at  your  service." 

"What  do  you  mean  by  that?" 

"Oh,  you  know  quite  well.  Why  do  you  want  to  make  me  say 
it?  Do  you  expect  a  declaration?  .  .  .  No,  no;  please  don't 
cloud  your  smile,  or  I  shall  catch  cold." 

"Come  now,  my  dear  boy,  you  are  not  going  to  pretend  that 
you  are  beginning  to  love  me." 

"Oh,  I'm  not  beginning,"  said  Bernard.  "It's  you  who  are 
beginning  to  feel  it,  perhaps;  but  you  can't  prevent  me." 

"It  was  so  delightful  for  me  not  to  have  to  be  on  my  guard 
with  you.  And  now,  if  I've  got  to  treat  you  like  inflammable 
matter  and  not  dare  go  near  you  without  taking  precau- 
tions .  .  .  But  think  of  the  deformed,  swollen  creature  I  shall 
soon  be.  The  mere  look  of  me  will  be  enough  to  cure  you." 

"Yes,  if  it  were  only  your  looks  that  I  loved.  And  then,  in  the 
first  place,  I'm  not  ill;  or  if  it  is  being  ill  to  love  you,  I  prefer 
not  to  be  cured." 

He  said  all  this  gravely,  almost  sadly;  he  looked  at  her  more 
tenderly  than  ever  Edouard  had  done,  or  Douviers,  but  so  re- 
spectfully that  she  could  not  take  umbrage.  She  was  holding 
an  English  book  they  had  been  reading,  on  her  lap,  and  was 
turning  over  its  pages  absently;  she  seemed  not  to  be  listening, 
so  that  Bernard  went  on  without  too  much  embarrassment: 

"I  used  to  imagine  love  as  something  volcanic — at  all  events 
the  love  I  was  destined  to  feel.  Yes;  I  really  thought  I  should 
only  be  able  to  love  in  a  savage,  devastating  way,  a  la  Byron. 
How  ill  I  knew  myself!  It  was  you,  Laura,  who  taught  me  to 
know  myself;  so  diff'erent  from  what  I  thought  I  was!  I  was 
playing  the  part  of  a  dreadful  person  and  making  desperate 
efforts  to  resemble  him.  When  I  think  of  the  letter  I  wrote  my 
supposed  father  before  I  left  home,  I  feel  very  much  ashamed, 
I  assure  you.  I  took  myself  for  a  rebel,  an  outlaw,  who  tramples 
underfoot  everything  that  opposes  his  desire;  and  now  here  I 
find  that  when  I  am  with  you  I  have  no  desires.  I  longed  for 
liberty  as  the  supreme  good,  and  no  sooner  was  I  free,  than  I 


183  BERNARD  AND  LAURA 

bowed  myself  to  your  .  .  .  Oh,  if  you  only  knew  how  madden- 
ing it  is  to  have  in  one's  head  quantities  of  phrases  from  great 
authors,  which  come  irresistibly  to  one's  lips  when  one  wants 
to  express  a  sincere  feeling.  This  feeling  of  mine  is  so  new  to  me 
that  I  haven't  yet  been  able  to  invent  a  language  for  it.  Let's 
say  it  isn't  love,  since  you  dislike  that  word;  let's  call  it  devo- 
tion. It's  as  though  this  liberty  which  seemed  to  me  so  infinite, 
had  had  limits  set  to  it  by  your  laws.  It's  as  though  all  the 
turbulent  and  unformed  things  that  were  stirring  within  me, 
were  dancing  an  harmonious  round,  with  you  for  their  centre. 
If  one  of  my  thoughts  happens  to  stray  from  you,  I  leave  it  .  .  . 
Laura,  I  don't  ask  you  to  love  me — I'm  nothing  but  a  school- 
boy; I'm  not  worth  your  notice;  but  everything  I  want  to  do 
now  is  in  order  to  deserve  your  ...  (oh!  the  word  is  fright- 
ful!) .  .  .  your  esteem.  .  .  ." 

He  had  gone  down  on  his  knees  before  her,  and  though  she 
had  at  first  drawn  her  chair  away  a  little,  Bernard's  forehead 
was  on  her  dress,  and  his  arms  thrown  back  behind  him,  in  sign 
of  adoration;  but  when  he  felt  Laura's  hand  laid  upon  his  fore- 
head, he  seized  the  hand  and  pressed  his  lips  to  it. 

"What  a  child  you  are,  Bernard!  I  am  not  free,  either,"  she 
said,  taking  away  her  hand.  "Here!  Read  this." 

She  took  from  her  bodice  a  crumpled  piece  of  paper,  which 
she  held  out  to  Bernard. 

Bernard  saw  the  signature  first  of  all.  As  he  feared,  it  was 
Felix  Douviers'.  One  moment  he  kept  the  letter  in  his  hand 
without  reading  it;  he  raised  his  eyes  to  look  at  Laura.  She  was 
crying.  Then  Bernard  felt  one  more  bond  burst  in  his  heart — 
one  of  the  secret  ties  which  bind  each  one  of  us  to  himself,  to 
his  selfish  past.  Then  he  read : 

My  beloved  Laura, 
In  the  name  of  the  little  child  who  is  to  be  born,  and  whom 
I  swear  to  love  as  if  I  were  its  father,  I  beseech  you  to  come 
back.  Don't  think  that  any  reproaches  will  meet  you  here. 
Don't  blame  yourself  too  much — that  is  what  hurts  me  most. 
Don't  delay.  My  whole  soul  awaits  you,  adores  you,  is  laid 
humbly  at  your  feet. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  184 

Bernard  was  sitting  on  the  floor  in  front  of  Laura,  but  it 
was  without  looking  at  her  that  he  asked: 

"When  did  you  get  this?" 

"This  morning." 

"I  thought  he  knew  nothing  about  it.  Did  you  write  and  tell 
him?" 

"Yes;  I  told  him  everything." 

"Does  Edouard  know  this?" 

"He  knows  nothing  about  it." 

Bernard  remained  silent  a  little  while  with  downcast  head; 
then  turning  towards  her  once  more: 

"And  .  .  .  what  do  you  mean  to  do  now?" 

"Do  you  really  ask?  .  .  .  Return  to  him.  It  is  with  him  that 
my  place  is — with  him  that  I  ought  to  live.  You  know  it." 

"Yes,"  said  Bernard. 

There  was  a  very  long  silence.  Bernard  broke  it : 

"Do  you  believe  one  can  love  someone  else's  child  as  much  as 
one's  own,  really?" 

"I  don't  know  if  I  believe  it,  but  I  hope  it." 

"For  my  part,  I  believe  one  can.  And,  on  the  contrary,  I  don't 
believe  in  what  people  call  so  foolishly  'the  blood  speaking.' 
I  believe  this  idea  that  the  blood  speaks  is  a  mere  myth.  I  have 
read  somewhere  that  among  certain  tribes  of  South  Sea  Island- 
ers, it  is  the  custom  to  adopt  other  people's  children,  and  that 
these  adopted  children  are  often  preferred  to  the  others.  The 
book  said — 1  remember  it  quite  well — 'made  more  of.'  Do  you 
know  what  I  think  now?  ...  I  think  that  my  supposed  father, 
who  stood  in  my  father's  place,  never  said  or  did  anything  that 
could  let  it  be  suspected  that  I  was  not  his  real  son;  that  in 
writing  to  him  as  I  did,  that  I  had  always  felt  the  difference,  I 
was  lying;  that,  on  the  contrary,  he  showed  a  kind  of  predilec- 
tion for  me,  which  I  felt  perfectly,  so  that  my  ingratitude  to- 
wards him  was  all  the  more  abominable;  and  that  I  behaved 
very  ill  to  him.  Laura,  my  friend,  I  should  like  to  ask  you  .  .  . 
Do  you  think  I  ought  to  beg  his  pardon  and  go  back  to  him?" 

"No,"  said  Laura. 

"Why  not?  Since  you  are  going  back  to  Douviers?" 


185  BERNARD  AND   LAURA 

"You  were  telling  me  just  now,  that  what  was  true  for  one 
is  not  true  for  another.  I  feel  I  am  weak;  you  are  strong.  Mon- 
sieur Profitendieu  may  love  you;  but  from  what  you  have  told 
me,  you  are  not  of  the  kind  to  understand  each  other.  ...  Or, 
at  any  rate,  wait  a  little.  Don't  go  back  to  him  worsted.  Do 
you  want  to  know  what  I  really  think? — that  it  is  for  me  and 
not  for  him  that  you  are  proposing  it — to  get  what  you  called 
'my  esteem.'  You  will  only  get  it,  Bernard,  if  I  feel  you  are  not 
seeking  for  it.  I  can  only  care  for  you  as  you  are  naturally. 
Leave  repentance  to  me.  It  is  not  for  you,  Bernard." 

"I  almost  get  to  like  my  name  when  I  hear  it  on  your  lips. 
Do  you  know  what  my  chief  horror  was  at  home?  The  luxury. 
So  much  comfort,  so  many  facilities  ...  I  felt  myself  becom- 
ing an  anarchist.  Now,  on  the  contrary,  I  think  I'm  veering 
toward  conservatism.  I  realized  that  the  other  day  because  of 
the  indignation  that  seized  me  when  I  heard  the  tourist  at  the 
frontier  speak  of  his  pleasure  in  cheating  the  customs.  'Robbing 
the  State  is  robbing  no  one,'  he  said.  My  feeling  of  antagonism 
made  me  suddenly  understand  what  the  State  was.  And  I  began 
to  have  an  affection  for  it,  simply  because  it  was  being  injured. 
I  had  never  thought  about  it  before.  'The  State  is  nothing  but  a 
convention,'  he  said,  too.  What  a  fine  thing  a  convention  would 
be  that  rested  on  the  bona  fides  of  every  individual!  ...  if 
only  there  were  nothing  but  honest  folk.  Why,  if  anyone 
were  to  ask  me  to-day  what  virtue  I  considered  the  finest,  I 
should  answer  without  hesitation — honesty.  Oh,  Laura!  I  should 
like  all  my  life  long,  at  the  very  smallest  shock,  to  ring  true, 
with  a  pure,  authentic  sound.  Nearly  all  the  people  I  have 
known  ring  false.  To  be  worth  exactly  what  one  seems  to  be 
worth — not  to  try  to  seem  to  be  worth  more.  .  .  .  One  wants 
to  deceive  people,  and  one  is  so  much  occupied  with  seeming, 
that  one  ends  by  not  knowing  what  one  really  is.  .  .  .  For- 
give me  for  talking  like  this.  They  are  my  last  night's  reflec- 
tions." 

"You  were  thinking  of  the  little  coin  you  showed  us  yester- 
day. When  I  go  away  .  .  ." 

She  could  not  finish  her  sentence;  the  tears  rose  to  her  eyes 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  186 

and  in  the  effort  she  made  to  keep  them  back,  Bernard  saw 
her  lips  tremble. 

"Then  you  are  going  away,  Laura  .  .  ."  he  went  on  sadly.  "I 
am  afraid  that  when  I  no  longer  feel  you  near  me,  I  shall  be 
worth  nothing  at  all — or  hardly  anything.  .  .  .  But,  tell  me — 
I  should  like  to  ask  you  .  .  .  would  you  be  going  away — would 
you  have  made  this  confession,  if  Edouard  ...  I  don't  know 
how  to  say  it  .  .  ."  (and  as  Laura  blushed),  if  Edouard  had 
been  worth  more?  Oh,  don't  protest.  I  know  so  well  what  you 
think  of  him." 

"You  say  that,  because  yesterday  you  caught  me  smiling  at 
what  he  said;  you  immediately  jumped  to  the  conclusion  that 
we  were  judging  him  in  the  same  way.  But  it's  not  so.  Don't 
deceive  yourself.  In  reality  I  don't  know  what  I  think  of  him. 
He  is  never  the  same  for  long  together.  He  is  attached  to  noth- 
ing, but  nothing  is  more  attractive  than  his  elusiveness.  He  is 
perpetually  forming,  unforming,  re-forming  himself.  One  thinks 
one  has  grasped  him.  .  .  .  Proteus!  He  takes  the  shape  of  what 
he  loves,  and  oneself  must  love  him  to  understand  him." 

"You  love  him.  Oh,  Laura!  it's  not  of  Douviers  I  feel  jealous, 
nor  of  Vincent;  it's  of  Edouard." 

"Why  jealous?  I  love  Douviers;  I  love  Edouard,  but  differ- 
ently. If  I  am  to  love  you,  it  must  be  with  yet  another  love." 

"Laura,  Laura,  you  don't  love  Douviers.  You  feel  affection 
for  him,  pity,  esteem;  but  that's  not  love.  I  think  the  secret  of 
your  sadness  (for  you  are  sad,  Laura)  is  that  life  has  divided 
you;  love  has  only  consented  to  take  you,  incomplete;  you  dis- 
tribute among  several  what  you  would  have  liked  to  give  to 
one  only.  As  for  me,  I  feel  I  am  indivisible;  I  can  only  give 
the  whole  of  myself." 

"You  are  too  young  to  speak  so.  You  cannot  tell  yet  whether 
life  will  not  'divide'  you  too,  as  you  call  it.  I  can  only  accept 
from  you  the  .  .  .  devotion  which  you  offer  me.  The  rest  will 
have  its  exigencies  and  will  have  to  be  satisfied  elsewhere." 

"Can  it  be  true?  Do  you  want  to  disgust  me  beforehand  with 
myself  and  with  life,  too?" 

"You  know  nothing  of  life.  Everything  is  before  you.  Do  you 


187  BERNARD   AND   LAURA 

know  what  my  mistake  was?  To  think  there  was  nothing  more 
for  me.  It  was  when  I  thought,  alas!  that  there  was  nothing 
more  for  me,  that  I  let  myself  go.  I  lived  that  last  spring  at 
Pau  as  if  I  were  never  to  see  another — as  if  nothing  mattered 
any  more.  I  can  tell  you  now,  Bernard,  now  that  I've  been 
punished  for  it —  Never  despair  of  life!" 

Of  what  use  is  it  to  speak  so  to  a  young  creature  full  of  fire? 
And  indeed  Laura  was  hardly  speaking  to  Bernard.  Touched 
by  his  sympathy,  and  almost  in  spite  of  herself,  she  was  think- 
ing aloud  in  his  presence.  She  was  unapt  at  feigning,  unapt  at 
self-control.  As  she  had  yielded  a  moment  ago  to  the  impulsive 
feeling  which  carried  her  away  whenever  she  thought  of  Edou- 
ard,  and  which  betrayed  her  love  for  him,  so  now  she  had 
given  way  to  a  certain  tendency  to  sermonize,  which  she  had  no 
doubt  inherited  from  her  father.  But  Bernard  had  a  horror  of 
recommendations  and  advice,  even  if  they  should  come  from 
Laura;  his  smile  told  her  as  much  and  she  went  on  more 
calmly: 

"Are  you  thinking  of  keeping  on  as  Edouard's  secretary  when 
you  go  back  to  Paris?" 

"Yes,  if  he  is  willing  to  employ  me;  but  he  gives  me  nothing 
to  do.  Do  you  know  what  would  amuse  me?  To  write  that  book 
of  his  with  him;  for  he'll  never  write  it  alone;  you  told  him  so 
yesterday.  That  method  of  working  he  described  to  us  seemed 
to  me  absurd.  A  good  novel  gets  itself  written  more  naively 
than  that.  And  first  of  all,  one  must  believe  in  one's  own  story 
— don't  you  think  so — and  tell  it  quite  simply?  I  thought  at 
one  time  I  might  help  him.  If  he  had  wanted  a  detective,  I 
might  perhaps  have  done  the  job.  He  could  have  worked  on 

the  facts  that  my  police  work  would  have  furnished  him 

But  with  an  idea-monger  there's  nothing  doing.  When  I'm  with 
him,  I  feel  that  I  have  the  soul  of  a  reporter.  If  he  sticks  to  his 
mistaken  ways,  I  shall  work  on  my  own  account.  I  must  earn 
my  living.  I  shall  offer  my  services  to  a  newspaper.  Between 
times  I  shall  write  verses." 

"For  when  you  are  with  reporters,  you'll  certainly  feel  your- 
self the  soul  of  a  poet." 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  188 

"Oh!  don't  laugh  at  me.  I  know  I'm  ridiculous.  Don't  rub  it 
in  too  much." 

"Stay  with  Edouard;  you'll  help  him;  and  let  him  help  you. 
He  is  very  good." 

The  luncheon  bell  rang.  Bernard  rose.  Laura  took  his  hand: 

"Just  one  thing — that  little  coin  you  showed  us  yesterday  .  .  . 
in  remembrance  of  you,  when  I  go  away" — she  pulled  herself 
together  and  this  time  was  able  to  finish  her  sentence — "would 
you  give  it  me?" 

"Here  it  is,"  said  Bernard,  "take  it." 


I 


EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:   CONVERSATION 
WITH    SOPHRONISKA 

C'est  ce  qui  arrive  de  presque  toutes  les 
maladies  de  I'esprit  humain  qu'on  se  flatte 
d'avoir  gueries.  On  les  repercute  seulement, 
comme  on  dit  en  medecine,  et  on  leur  en  sub- 
stitue  d'autres. 

Sainte-Beuve  (Lundis,  1,  p.  19) 

I  AM  beginning  to  catch  sight  of  what  I  might  call  the  "deep- 
lying  subject"  of  my  book.  It  is — it  will  be — no  doubt,  the 
rivalry  between  the  real  world  and  the  representation  of  it 
which  we  make  to  ourselves.  The  manner  in  which  the  world  of 
appearances  imposes  itself  upon  us,  and  the  manner  in  which  we 
try  to  impose  on  the  outside  world  our  own  interpretation — 
this  is  the  drama  of  our  lives.  The  resistance  of  facts  invites  us 
to  transport  our  ideal  construction  into  the  realm  of  dreams,  of 
hope,  of  belief  in  a  future  life,  which  is  fed  by  all  the  dis- 
appointments and  disillusions  of  our  present  one.  Realists  start 
from  facts — fit  their  ideas  to  suit  the  facts.  Bernard  is  a  realist. 
I  am  afraid  we  shall  never  understand  each  other. 

How  could  I  agree  when  Sophroniska  told  me  I  had  nothing 
of  the  mystic  in  me?  I  am  quite  ready  to  recognize,  as  she  does, 
that  without  mysticism  man  can  achieve  nothing  great.  But 
is  it  not  precisely  my  mysticism  which  Laura  incriminates  when 
I  speak  of  my  book?  .  .  .  Well,  let  them  settle  the  argument 
as  they  please. 

Sophroniska  has  been  speaking  to  me  again  about  Boris,  from 
whom  she  thinks  she  has  succeeded  in  obtaining  a  full  confes- 
sion. The  poor  child  has  not  got  the  smallest  covert,  the  smallest 
tuft  left  in  him,  where  he  can  take  shelter  from  the  doctor's 
scrutiny.  He  has  been  driven  into  the  open.  Sophroniska  takes 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  190 

to  bits  the  innermost  wheels  of  his  mental  organism  and  spreads 
them  out  in  the  broad  daylight,  like  a  watchmaker  cleaning  the 
works  of  a  clock.  If  after  that  he  does  not  keep  good  time,  it's 
a  hopeless  job.  This  is  what  Sophroniska  told  me: 

When  Boris  was  about  nine  years  old,  he  was  sent  to  school 
at  Warsaw.  He  there  made  friends  with  a  schoolfellow  one  or 
two  years  older  than  himself — one  Baptistin  Kraft,  who  ini- 
tiated him  into  certain  clandestine  practices,  which  the  children 
in  their  ignorance  and  astonishment  believed  to  be  "magic." 
This  is  the  name  they  bestowed  upon  their  vice,  from  having 
heard  or  read  that  magic  enables  one  in  some  mysterious  way  to 
gain  possession  of  what  one  wishes  for,  that  it  gives  unlimited 
powers  and  so  forth.  ,  .  .  They  believed  in  all  good  faith  that 
they  had  discovered  a  secret  which  made  up  for  real  absence  by 
illusory  presence,  and  they  freely  put  themselves  in  a  state  of 
hallucination  and  ecstasy,  gloating  over  an  empty  void,  which 
their  heated  imagination,  stimulated  by  their  desire  for  pleas- 
ure, filled  to  overflowing  with  marvels.  Needless  to  say,  So- 
phroniska did  not  make  use  of  these  terms;  I  should  have  liked 
her  to  repeat  exactly  what  Boris  said,  but  she  declares  she  only 
succeeded  in  making  out  the  above — though  she  certified  its  ac- 
curacy— through  a  tangle  of  pretences,  reticence  and  vagueness. 

"I  have  at  last  found  out  the  explanation  of  something  I 
have  been  trying  to  discover  for  a  long  time  past,"  she  added, 
" — of  a  bit  of  parchment  which  Boris  used  always  to  wear  hang- 
ing round  his  neck  in  a  little  sachet,  along  with  the  religious 
medallions  his  mother  forces  him  to  wear.  There  were  six  words 
on  it,  written  in  capital  letters  in  a  childish,  painstaking  hand — 
six  words  whose  meaning  he  never  would  tell  me. 

"GAS  .  TELEPHONE  .  .  .  ONE  HUNDRED  THOUSAND 
ROUBLES 

"  'But  it  means  nothing — it's  magic,'  he  used  always  to  answer 
whenever  I  pressed  him.  That  was  all  I  could  get  out  of  him.  I 
know  now  that  these  enigmatic  words  are  in  young  Baptistin's 
handwriting — the  grand  master  and  professor  of  magic — and 
that  these  six  words  were  the  boys'  formula  of  incantation — the 


191  CONVERSATION  WITH  SOPHRONISKA 

'Open  Sesame'  of  the  shameful  Paradise,  into  which  their  pleas- 
ure plunged  them.  Boris  called  this  bit  of  parchment,  his  talis- 
man. I  had  great  difficulty  in  persuading  him  to  let  me  see  it  and 
still  greater  in  persuading  him  to  give  it  up  (it  was  at  the  be- 
ginning of  our  stay  here);  for  I  wanted  him  to  give  it  up,  as 
I  know  now  that  he  had  already  given  up  his  bad  habits.  I  had 
hopes  that  the  tics  and  manias  from  which  he  suffers  would  dis- 
appear with  the  talisman.  But  he  clung  to  it  and  his  illness 
clung  to  it  as  to  a  last  refuge." 

"But  you  said  he  had  already  given  up  his  bad  habits.  .  .  ." 
"His  nervous  illness  only  began  after  that.  It  arose  no  doubt 
from  the  constraint  Boris  was  obliged  to  exercise  in  order  to  get 
free  from  them.  I  have  just  learnt  from  him  that  his  mother 
caught  him  one  day  in  the  act  of  'doing  magic/  as  he  says.  Why 
did  she  never  tell  me?  ...  out  of  false  shame?  .  .  ." 
"And  no  doubt  because  she  knew  he  was  cured." 
"Absurd!  .  .  .  And  that  is  why  I  have  been  in  the  dark  so 
long.  I  told  you  that  I  thought  Boris  was  perfectly  pure." 
"You  even  told  me  that  you  were  embarrassed  by  it." 
"You  see  how  right  I  was!  .  .  .  The  mother  ought  to  have 
warned  me.  Boris  would  be  cured  already  if  I  had  known  this 
from  the  beginning." 
"You  said  these  troubles  only  began  later  on.  .  .  ." 
"I  said  they  arose  as  a  protestation.  His  mother,  I  imagine, 
scolded,  begged,  preached.  Then  his  father  died.  Boris  was  con- 
vinced that  this  was  the  punishment  of  these  secret  practices  he 
had  been  told  were  so  wicked;  he  held  himself  responsible  for 
his  father's  death;  he  thought  himself  criminal,  damned.  He 
took  fright;  and  it  was  then  that  his  weakly  organism,  like  a 
tracked  animal,  invented  all  these  little  subterfuges,  by  means  of 
which  he  works  off  his  secret  sense  of  guilt,  and  which  are  so 
many  avowals." 

"If  I  understand  you  rightly,  you  think  it  would  have  been 
less  prejudicial  to  Boris  if  he  had  gone  quietly  on  with  his 
'magic'?" 

"I  think  he  might  have  been  cured  without  being  frightened. 
The  change  of  life  which  was  made  necessary  by  his  father's 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  192 

death  would  have  been  enough,  no  doubt,  to  distract  his  atten- 
tion, and  when  they  left  Warsaw  he  would  have  been  removed 
from  his  friend's  influence.  No  good  result  is  to  be  arrived  at 
by  terror.  Once  I  knew  the  facts,  1  talked  the  whole  thing  over 
with  him,  and  made  him  ashamed  of  having  preferred  the  pos- 
session of  imaginary  goods  to  the  real  goods  which  are,  I  told 
him,  the  reward  of  effort.  Far  from  attempting  to  blacken  his 
vice,  I  represented  it  to  him  simply  as  one  of  the  forms  of  lazi- 
ness; and  I  really  believe  it  is — the  most  subtle — the  most 
perfidious." 

These  words  brought  back  to  my  mind  some  lines  of  La 
Rochefoucauld,  which  I  thought  I  should  like  to  show  her,  and, 
though  I  might  have  quoted  them  by  heart,  I  went  to  fetch 
the  little  book  of  Maxims,  without  which  I  never  travel.  I  read 
her  the  following: 

"Of  all  the  passions,  the  one  about  which  we  ourselves  know 
least  is  laziness,  the  fiercest  and  the  most  evil  of  them  all,  though 
its  violence  goes  unperceived  and  the  havoc  it  causes  lies  hid- 
den. .  .  .  The  repose  of  laziness  has  a  secret  charm  for  the  soul, 
suddenly  suspending  its  most  ardent  pursuits  and  most  ob- 
stinate resolutions.  To  give,  in  fine,  some  idea  of  this  passion, 
it  should  be  said  that  laziness  is  like  a  state  of  beatitude,  in 
which  the  soul  is  consoled  for  all  its  losses,  and  which  stands  in 
lieu  to  it  of  all  its  possessions."  ^ 

"Do  you  mean  to  say,"  said  Sophroniska  then,  "that  La 
Rochefoucauld  was  hinting  at  what  we  have  been  speaking  of, 
when  he  wrote  that?" 

"Possibly;  but  I  don't  think  so.  Our  classical  authors  have  a 

1  De  toutes  les  passions,  celle  qui  est  la  plus  inconnue  a  nous-mimes, 
c'est  la  par  esse;  elle  est  la  plus  ardente  et  la  plus  maligne  de  toutes, 
quoique  sa  violence  soit  insensible  et  que  les  dommages  quelle  cause 
soient  tres-caches  .  .  .  Le  repos  de  la  paresse  est  un  charme  secret 
de  I'dvie  qui  suspend  soudainement  les  plus  ardentes  poursuites  et  les 
plus  opinidtres  resolutions.  Pour  donner  enfin  la  veritable  idee  de 
cette  passion,  il  faut  dire  que  la  paresse  est  comme  une  beatitude  de 
I'dme,  qui  la  console  de  toutes  ses  pertes  et  qui  lui  tient  lieu  de  tous 
ses  biens.

193  CONVERSATION  WITH  SOPHRONISKA 

right  to  all  the  interpretations  they  allow  of.  That  is  why  they 
are  so  rich.  Their  precision  is  all  the  more  admirable  in  that  it 
does  not  claim  to  be  exclusive." 

I  asked  her  to  show  me  this  wonderful  talisman  of  Boris's. 
She  told  me  it  was  no  longer  in  her  possession,  as  she  had  given 
it  to  a  person  who  was  interested  in  Boris  and  who  had  asked 
her  for  it  as  a  souvenir.  "A  certain  M.  Strouvilhou,  whom  I 
met  here  some  time  before  your  arrival." 

I  told  Sophroniska  then,  that  I  had  seen  the  name  in  the 
visitors'  book,  and  that  as  I  had  formerly  known  a  Strouvilhou, 
I  was  curious  to  learn  whether  it  was  the  same.  From  the  de- 
scription she  gave  of  him  it  was  impossible  to  doubt  it.  But 
she  could  tell  me  nothing  that  satisfied  my  curiosity.  I  merely 
learnt  that  he  was  very  polite,  very  attentive,  that  he  seemed 
to  her  exceedingly  intelligent,  but  a  little  lazy,  "if  I  dare  still 
use  the  word,"  she  added,  laughing.  In  my  turn  I  told  her  all 
I  knew  of  Strouvilhou,  and  that  led  me  to  speak  of  the 
boarding  school  where  we  had  first  met,  of  Laura's  parents  (she 
too  had  been  confiding  in  her),  and  finally  of  old  La  Perouse,  of 
his  relationship  with  Boris,  and  of  the  promise  I  had  made  him 
to  bring  the  child  back  to  Paris.  As  Sophroniska  had  previously 
said  that  it  was  not  desirable  Boris  should  live  with  his  mother, 
"Why  don't  you  send  him  to  Azais's  school?"  I  asked.  In  sug- 
gesting this,  I  was  thinking  especially  of  his  grandfather's  im- 
mense joy  at  having  him  so  near,  and  staying  with  friends 
where  he  could  see  him  whenever  he  liked.  Sophroniska  said 
she  would  think  it  over;  extremely  interested  by  everything  I 
told  her. 

Sophroniska  goes  on  repeating  that  little  Boris  is  cured — a 
cure  which  is  supposed  to  corroborate  her  method;  but  I  am 
afraid  she  is  anticipating  a  little.  Of  course  I  don't  want  to 
set  my  opinion  against  hers,  and  I  admit  that  his  tics,  his  way 
of  contradicting  himself,  his  hesitations  of  speech  have  almost 
entirely  disappeared;  but,  to  my  mind,  the  malady  has  simply 
taken  refuge  in  some  deeper  recess  of  his  being,  as  though  to 
escape  the  doctor's  inquisitorial  glance,  and  now  it  is  his  soul 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  194 

itself  which  is  the  seat  of  mischief.  Just  as  onanism  was  suc- 
ceeded by  nervous  movements,  so  these  movements  have  given 
place  to  some  strange  undefmable,  invisible  state  of  terror. 
Soghroniska,  it  is  true,  is  uneasy  at  seeing  Boris,  following 
upon  Bronja's  lead,  fling  himself  into  a  sort  of  puerile  mysti- 
cism; she  is  too  intelligent  not  to  understand  that  this  new 
"beatitude"  which  Boris  is  now  seeking,  is  not  very  different 
after  all  from  the  one  he  at  first  provoked  by  artifice,  and  that 
though  it  may  be  less  wasteful,  less  ruinous  to  the  organism,  it 
turns  him  aside  quite  as  much  from  effort  and  realization.  But 
when  I  say  this  she  replies  that  creatures  like  Boris  and  Bronja 
cannot  do  without  some  idealistic  food,  and  that  if  they  were 
deprived  of  it,  they  would  succumb — Bronja  to  despair,  and 
Boris  to  a  vulgar  materialism;  she  thinks  she  has  no  right  to 
destroy  the  children's  confidence,  and  though  she  thinks  their 
belief  is  untrue,  she  must  needs  see  in  it  a  sublimation  of  low 
instincts,  a  higher  postulation,  an  incitement,  a  safeguard,  a 
what-not.  .  .  .  Without  herself  believing  in  the  dogmas  of  the 
Church,  she  believes  in  the  efficacy  of  faith.  She  speaks  with 
emotion  of  the  two  children's  piety,  of  how  they  read  the  Apoc- 
alypse together,  of  their  fervour,  their  talk  with  angels,  their 
white-robed  souls.  Like  all  women,  she  is  full  of  contradictions. 
But  she  was  right — I  am  decidedly  not  a  mystic  .  .  .  any  more 
than  I  am  lazy.  I  rely  on  the  atmosphere  of  Azai's's  school  to 
turn  Boris  into  a  worker;  to  cure  him  in  a  word  of  seeking 
after  imaginary  goods.  That  is  where  his  salvation  lies.  So- 
phroniska,  I  think,  is  coming  round  to  the  idea  of  confiding  him 
to  my  care;  but  she  will  no  doubt  accompany  him  to  Paris  so 
as  to  be  able  to  settle  him  into  the  school  herself,  and  so  reassure 
his  mother,  whose  consent  she  makes  sure  of  obtaining.

FROM   OLIVIER   TO   BERNARD 

II  y  a  de  certains  defauts  qui,  bien  mis  en 
(Buvre   brillent  plus   que   la   vertu  meme. 
La  Rochefoucauld. 

Dear  old  fellow — 

I  must  first  tell  you  that  I  have  passed  my  bachot  all  right. 
But  that's  of  no  importance.  A  unique  opportunity  came  in 
my  way  of  travelling  for  a  bit.  I  was  still  hesitating;  but  after 
reading  your  letter,  I  jumped  at  it.  My  mother  made  some  ob- 
jections at  first;  but  Vincent  soon  got  over  them.  He  has  been 
nicer  than  I  could  have  hoped.  I  cannot  believe  that  in  the  cir- 
cumstances you  allude  to,  he  can  have  behaved  like  a  cad.  At 
our  age,  we  have  an  unfortunate  tendency  to  judge  people  se- 
verely and  condemn  them  without  appeal.  Many  actions  appear 
to  us  reprehensible — odious  even — simply  because  we  don't  en- 
ter sufficiently  into  their  motives.  Vincent  didn't  ,  .  .  but  this 
would  take  too  long  and  I  have  too  many  things  to  say  to  you. 

You  must  know  that  the  writer  of  this  letter  is  no  less  a 
person  than  the  editor-in-chief  of  the  new  review,  The  Van- 
guard. After  some  reflection  I  agreed  to  take  up  this  responsible 
position,  as  Comte  Robert  de  Passavant  considered  I  should  fill 
it  worthily.  It  is  he  who  is  financing  the  review,  though  he  doesn't 
care  about  its  being  known  just  yet,  and  my  name  is  to  figure 
alone  on  the  cover.  We  shall  come  out  in  October;  try  to  send 
me  something  for  the  first  number;  I  should  be  heart-broken  if 
your  name  didn't  adorn  the  first  list  of  contents  alongside  of 
mine.  Passavant  would  like  the  first  number  to  contain  some- 
thing rather  shocking  and  spicy,  for  he  thinks  the  most  appall- 
ing thing  that  can  be  said  against  a  new  review  is  that  it  is 
mealy-mouthed.  I'm  inclined  to  agree  with  him.  We  discuss  it 
a  great  deal.  He  has  asked  me  to  write  the  thing  in  question 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  196 

and  has  provided  me  with  a  rather  risky  subject  for  a  short 
story;  it  worries  me  a  little  because  of  my  mother,  who  may  be 
hurt  by  it.  But  it  can't  be  helped.  As  Passavant  says,  the 
younger  one  is,  the  less  compromising  the  scandal. 

I  am  writing  this  from  Vizzavone.  Vizzavone  is  a  little  place 
half  way  up  one  of  the  highest  mountains  in  Corsica,  buried  in 
a  thick  forest.  The  hotel  in  which  we  are  staying  is  some  way 
off  the  village  and  is  used  by  tourists  as  a  starting  place  for  their 
excursions.  We  have  been  here  only  a  few  days.  We  began  by 
staying  in  an  inn  not  far  from  the  beautiful  bay  of  Porto, 
where  we  bathed  every  morning;  it  is  absolutely  deserted  and 
one  can  spend  the  whole  day  without  a  stitch  on  one.  It  was 
marvellous;  but  the  weather  turned  too  hot  and  we  had  to  go 
up  to  the  mountains. 

Passavant  is  a  delightful  companion;  he  isn't  at  all  stuck  up 
about  his  title;  he  likes  me  to  call  him  Robert;  and  the  name 
he  has  invented  for  me  is  Olive — isn't  it  charming?  He  does  all 
he  can  to  make  me  forget  his  age  and  I  assure  you  he  does.  My 
mother  was  rather  alarmed  at  the  idea  of  my  going  away  with 
him,  for  she  hardly  knows  him  at  all.  I  hesitated  at  first  for 
fear  of  distressing  her.  Before  your  letter  came  I  had  almost 
given  it  up.  Vincent  persuaded  her,  however,  and  your  letter 
suddenly  gave  me  courage.  We  spent  the  last  days  before  start- 
ing in  doing  a  round  of  shops.  Passavant  is  so  generous  that 
he  is  always  wanting  to  give  me  things  and  I  had  to  stop  him 
all  the  time.  But  he  thought  my  wretched  rags  frightful;  shirts, 
ties,  socks — nothing  I  had  pleased  him;  he  kept  repeating  that 
if  we  were  to  spend  some  time  together,  it  would  be  too  painful 
to  him  not  to  see  me  properly  dressed — that  is  to  say,  as  he 
likes.  Naturally  everything  we  bought  was  sent  to  his  house, 
for  fear  of  making  my  mother  uncomfortable.  He  himself  is  ex- 
quisitely elegant;  but  above  all  his  taste  is  very  good,  and  a 
great  many  things  which  I  used  to  think  quite  bearable  now 
seem  odious  to  me.  You  can't  imagine  how  amusing  he  was  in 
the  shops.  He  is  really  very  witty.  1  should  like  to  give  you  an 
idea  of  it.  One  day,  we  were  at  Brentano's,  where  he  was  having 
a  fountain  pen  mended.  There  was  a  huge  Englishman  just  be- 
hind him  who  wanted  to  be  served  before  his  turn,  and  as 
Robert  pushed  him  away  rather  roughly,  he  began  to  jabber 
something  or  other  in  his  lingo;  Robert  turned  round  very 
calmly  and  said: 


197  OLIVIER  TO   BERNARD 

"It's  not  a  bit  of  use.  I  don't  understand  English." 

The  Englishman  was  in  a  rage  and  answered  back  in  the 
purest  French: 

"Then  you  ought  to." 

To  which  Robert  answered  with  a  polite  smile: 

"I  told  you  it  wasn't  a  bit  of  use." 

The  Englishman  was  boiling  over,  but  he  hadn't  another 
word  to  say.  It  was  killing. 

Another  day  we  were  at  the  Olympia.  During  the  entr'acte 
we  were  in  the  promenade  with  a  lot  of  prostitutes  walking 
round.  Two  of  them — rather  decayed  looking  creatures — ac- 
costed him : 

"Stand  us  a  glass  of  beer,  dearie?" 

We  sat  down  at  a  table  with  them. 

"Waiter!  A  glass  of  beer  for  these  ladies." 

"And  for  you  and  the  young  gentleman,  sir?" 

"Oh,  for  us?  We'll  take  champagne,"  he  said  carelessly.  He 
ordered  a  bottle  of  Moet,  and  we  blew  it  all  to  ourselves.  You 
should  have  seen  the  poor  things'  faces!  ...  I  think  he  has  a 
loathing  for  prostitutes.  He  confided  to  me  that  he  has  never 
been  inside  a  brathel,  and  gave  me  to  understand  that  he  would 
be  very  angry  with  me  if  I  ever  went.  So  you  see  he's  perfectly 
all  right  in  spite  of  his  airs  and  his  cynical  talk — as,  for  in- 
stance, when  he  says  he  calls  it  a  "dull  day"  if  he  hasn't  met 
at  least  five  people  before  lunch,  with  whom  he  wants  to  go  to 
bed.  (I  must  tell  you  by  the  way,  that  I  haven't  tried  again 
.  .  .  you  know  what.) 

He  has  a  particularly  odd  and  amusing  way  of  moralizing. 
The  other  day  he  said  to  me: 

"You  see,  my  dear  boy,  the  important  thing  in  life  is  not  to 
step  on  to  the  downward  path.  On  thing  leads  on  to  another 
and  one  never  can  tell  how  it  will  end.  For  instance,  I  once 
knew  a  very  worthy  young  man  who  was  engaged  to  marry  my 
cook's  daughter.  One  night  he  chanced  to  go  into  a  small 
jeweller's  shop;  he  killed  the  owner;  then  he  robbed;  after  that 
he  dissembled.  You  see  where  it  leads.  The  last  time  I  saw  him 
he  had  taken  to  lying.  So  do  be  careful." 

"He's  like  that  the  whole  time.  So  there's  no  chance  of  being 
bored.  We  left  with  the  idea  of  getting  through  a  lot  of  work, 
but  so  far  we've  done  nothing  but  bathe,  dry  in  the  sun  and 
talk.  He  has  extremely  original  ideas  and  opinions  about  every- 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  198 

thing.  I  am  trying  to  persuade  him  all  I  can  to  write  about  some 
new  theories  he  has  on  deep-sea  fishes  and  what  he  calls  their 
"private  lights,"  which  enables  them  to  do  without  the  light  of 
the  sun — which  he  compares  to  grace  and  revelation.  Told 
baldly  like  that  it  doesn't  sound  anything,  but  I  assure  you  that 
when  he  talks  about  it,  it's  as  interesting  as  a  novel.  People 
don't  know  that  he's  extremely  well  up  in  natural  history;  but 
he  kind  of  prides  himself  on  hiding  his  knowledge — what  he 
calls  his  secret  jewels.  He  says  it's  only  snobs  who  like  showing 
off  all  their  possessions — especially  if  they're  imitation. 

He  knows  admirably  well  how  to  make  use  of  ideas,  images, 
people,  things;  that  is,  he  gets  something  out  of  everything.  He 
says  the  great  art  of  life  is  not  so  much  to  enjoy  things  as  to 
make  the  most  of  them. 

I  have  written  a  few  verses,  but  I  don't  care  enough  about 
them  to  send  them  to  you. 

Good-bye,  old  boy.  Till  October.  You  will  find  me  changed, 
too.  Every  day  I  get  a  little  more  self-confidence.  I  am  glad  to 
hear  you  are  in  Switzerland,  but  you  see  that  I  have  no  cause  to 
envy  you. 

Olivier. 

Bernard  held  this  letter  out  to  Edouard,  who  read  it  without 
showing  any  sign  of  the  feelings  that  agitated  him. 

Everything  that  Olivier  said  of  Robert  with  such  compla- 
cency filled  him  with  indignation  and  put  the  final  touch  to  his 
detestation.  What  hurt  him  more  than  anything  was  that  Olivier 
had  not  even  mentioned  him  in  his  letter  and  seemed  to  have 
forgotten  him.  He  tried  in  vain  to  decipher  three  lines  of  post- 
script, which  had  been  heavily  inked  over  and  which  had  run  as 
follows: 

"Tell  Uncle  E.  that  I  think  of  him  constantly;  that  I  cannot 
forgive  him  for  having  chucked  me  and  that  my  heart  has  been 
mortally  wounded." 

These  lines  were  the  only  sincere  ones  in  a  letter  which  had 
been  written  for  show  and  inspired  by  pique.  Olivier  had  crossed 
them  out. 

Edouard  gave  the  horrible  letter  back  to  Bernard  without 
breathing  a  word;  without  breathing  a  word,  Bernard  took  it. 


199  OLIVIER  TO   BERNARD 

I  have  said  before  that  they  didn't  speak  to  each  other  much — 
a  kind  of  strange,  inexplicable  constraint  weighed  upon  them 
when  they  were  alone  together.  (I  confess  I  don't  like  the  word 
"inexplicable"  and  use  it  only  because  I  am  momentarily  at  a 
loss.)  But  that  evening,  when  they  were  alone  in  their  room  and 
getting  ready  to  go  to  bed,  Bernard,  with  a  great  effort  and  the 
words  sticking  in  his  throat  a  little,  asked: 

"I  suppose  Laura  has  shown  you  Douviers'  letter?" 

"I  never  doubted  that  Douviers  would  take  it  properly,"  said 
Edouard,  getting  into  bed.  "He's  an  excellent  fellow — a  little 
weak,  perhaps,  but  still  excellent.  He'll  adore  the  child,  I'm  sure. 
And  it'll  certainly  be  more  robust  than  if  it  were  his  own.  For 
he  doesn't  strike  me  as  being  much  of  a  Hercules." 

Bernard  was  much  too  fond  of  Laura  not  to  be  shocked  by 
Edouard's  cool  way  of  talking;  but  he  did  not  let  it  be  seen. 

"So!"  went  on  Edouard,  putting  out  his  candle,  "I  am  glad 
to  see  that  after  all  there  is  to  be  a  satisfactory  ending  to  this 
affair,  which  at  one  time  seemed  as  if  it  could  only  lead  to 
despair.  Anybody  may  make  a  false  start;  the  important  thing 
is  not  to  persist  in  .  .  ." 

"Evidently,"  interrupted  Bernard,  who  wanted  to  change  the 
subject. 

"1  must  confess,  Bernard,  that  I  am  afraid  I  have  made  one 
with  you." 

"A  false  start?" 

"Yes;  I'm  afraid  so.  In  spite  of  all  the  affection  I  have  for 
you,  I  have  been  thinking  for  the  last  few  days  that  we  aren't 
the  sort  to  understand  each  other  and  that  .  .  ."  (he  hesitated 
a  few  seconds  to  find  his  words)  ".  .  .  staying  with  me  longer 
would  set  you  on  the  wrong  track." 

Bernard  had  been  thinking  the  same  till  Edouard  spoke;  but 
Edouard  could  certainly  have  said  nothing  more  likely  to  bring 
Bernard  back.  The  instinct  of  contradiction  carried  the  day  and 
he  protested. 

"You  don't  know  me  yet,  and  I  don't  know  myself.  You 
haven't  put  me  to  the  test.  If  you  have  no  complaint  against  me, 
mayn't  I   ask  you  to  wait  a  little  longer?   I   admit  that  we 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  200 

aren't  at  all  like  each  other:  but  my  idea  was  precisely  that  it 
was  better  for  each  of  us  that  we  shouldn't  be  too  much  alike. 
I  think  that  if  I  can  help  you,  it'll  be  above  all  by  being  dif- 
ferent and  by  the  new  things  I  may  be  able  to  bring  you.  If  I 
am  wrong,  it  will  be  always  time  enough  to  tell  me  so.  I  am 
not  the  kind  of  person  to  complain  or  recriminate.  See  here — 
this  is  what  I  propose — it  may  be  idiotic.  ,  .  .  Little  Boris,  I 
understand,  is  to  go  to  the  Vedel-Azais  school.  Wasn't  Sophro- 
niska  telling  you  that  she  was  afraid  he  would  feel  a  little 
lost  there?  Supposing  I  were  to  go  there  myself,  with  a  recom- 
mendation from  Laura;  couldn't  I  get  some  kind  of  place — • 
under-master — usher — something  or  other?  I  have  got  to  earn 
my  living.  I  shouldn't  ask  much — just  my  board  and  lodging. 
.  .  .  Sophroniska  seems  to  trust  me  and  I  get  on  very  well  with 
Boris.  I  would  look  after  him,  help  him,  tutor  him,  be  his  friend 
and  protector.  But  at  the  same  time  1  should  remain  at  your  dis- 
position, work  for  you  in  the  intervals  and  be  at  hand  at  your 
smallest  sign.  Tell  me  what  you  say  to  that?" 

And  as  if  to  give  "that"  greater  weight,  he  added: 
"I  have  been  thinking  of  it  for  the  last  two  days." 
Which  wasn't  true.  If  he  hadn't  invented  it  on  the  spur  of 
the  moment,  he  would  have  already  spoken  to  Laura  about  it. 
But  what  was  true,  and  what  he  didn't  say,  was  that  ever  since 
his  indiscreet  reading  of  Edouard's  journal,  and  since  his  meet- 
ing with  Laura,  his  thoughts  often  turned  to  the  Vedels'  board- 
ing school;  he  wanted  to  know  Armand,  Olivier's  friend,  of 
whom  he  never  spoke;  he  wanted  still  more  to  know  Sarah,  the 
younger  sister;  but  his  curiosity  remained  a  secret  one;  out  of 
consideration  for  Laura,  he  did  not  even  own  it  to  himself. 

Edouard  said  nothing;  and  yet  Bernard's  plan  in  so  far  as 
it  provided  him  with  a  domicile,  pleased  him.  He  didn't  at  all 
care  for  the  idea  of  taking  him  in  himself.  Bernard  blew  out  his 
candle,  and  then  went  on : 

"Don't  think  that  1  didn't  understand  what  you  said  about 
your  book  and  about  the  conflict  you  imagine  between  brute 
reality  and  .  .  ." 
"I  don't  imagine  it,"  said  Edouard,  "it  exists." 


201  OLIVIER  TO   BERNARD 

"But  for  that  very  reason,  wouldn't  it  be  a  good  thing  if  I 
were  to  beat  in  a  few  facts  for  you,  so  as  to  give  you  something 
to  fight  with?  I  could  do  your  observing  for  you." 

Edouard  had  a  suspicion  that  he  was  laughing  at  him  a  little. 
The  truth  is  he  felt  humiliated  by  Bernard.  He  expressed  him- 
self too  well.  .  .  . 
■    "We'll  think  it  over,"  said  Edouard. 

A  long  time  went  by.  Bernard  tried  in  vain  to  sleep.  Olivier's 
letter  kept  tormenting  him.  Finally,  unable  to  hold  out  any 
longer,  and  hearing  Edouard  tossing  in  his  bed,  he  murmured: 

"If  you  aren't  asleep,  1  should  like  to  ask  you  one  thing 
more.  .  .  .  What  do  you  think  of  the  Comte  de  Passavant?" 

"I  should  think  you  could  pretty  well  imagine,"  said  Edou- 
ard. Then,  after  a  moment:  "Are  you?" 

"I?"  said  Bernard  savagely,  "...  I  could  kill  him." 


VII 

THE  AUTHOR  REVIEWS  HIS  CHARACTERS 

The  traveller,  having  reached  the  top  of  the  hill,  sits  down  and 
looks  about  him  before  continuing  his  journey,  which  hence- 
forward lies  all  downhill.  He  seeks  to  distinguish  in  the  dark- 
ness— for  night  is  falling — where  the  winding  path  he  has 
chosen  is  leading  him.  So  the  undiscerning  author  stops  awhile 
to  regain  his  breath,  and  wonders  with  some  anxiety  where  his 
tale  will  take  him. 

I  am  afraid  that  Edouard,  in  confiding  little  Boris  to  Aza'is's 
care,  is  committing  an  imprudence.  Every  creature  acts  ac- 
cording to  his  own  law  and  Edouard's  leads  him  to  constant 
experimentalizing.  He  has  a  kind  heart,  no  doubt,  but  for  the 
sake  of  others  1  should  prefer  to  see  him  act  out  of  self-interest; 
for  the  generosity  which  impels  him  is  often  merely  the  accom- 
paniment of  a  curiosity  which  is  liable  to  turn  into  cruelty.  He 
knows  Azais's  school;  he  knows  the  poisonous  air  that  reigns  in 
it,  under  the  stifling  cover  of  morality  and  religion.  He  knows 
Boris — how  tender  he  is — how  fragile.  He  ought  to  foresee  the 
rubs  to  which  he  is  exposing  him.  But  he  refuses  to  consider 
anything  but  the  protection,  the  help,  the  support,  which  old 
Azais's  austerity  will  afford  the  little  boy's  precarious  purity. 
To  what  sophisms  does  he  not  lend  an  ear?  They  must  be  the 
promptings  of  the  devil,  for  if  they  came  from  anyone  else,  he 
would  not  listen  to  them. 

Edouard  has  irritated  me  more  than  once  (when  he  speaks 
of  Douviers,  for  instance) — enraged  me  even;  I  hope  I  haven't 
shown  it  too  much;  but  now  I  may  be  allowed  to  say  so.  His 
behaviour  to  Laura — at  times  so  generous — has  at  times  seemed 
to  me  revolting. 


203  REVIEW  OF  THE  CHARACTERS 

What  I  dislike  about  Edouard  are  the  reasons  he  gives  him- 
self. Why  does  he  try  and  persuade  himself  that  he  is  con- 
spiring for  Boris's  good?  Does  the  torrent  which  drowns  a  child 
pretend  that  it  is  giving  him  drink?  ...  I  do  not  deny  that 
there  are  actions  in  the  world  that  are  noble,  generous  and  even 
disinterested;  I  only  say  that  there  often  lies  hidden  behind  the 
good  motive  a  devil  who  is  clever  enough  to  find  his  profit  in 
the  very  thing  one  thought  one  was  wresting  from  him. 

Let  us  make  use  of  this  summer  season  which  disperses  our 
characters  to  examine  them  at  leisure.  And  besides,  we  have 
reached  that  middle  point  of  our  story,  when  its  pace  seems 
to  slacken,  in  order  to  gather  a  new  impetus  and  rush  on  again 
with  swifter  speed  to  its  end.  Bernard  is  assuredly  much  too 
young  to  take  direction  of  an  intrigue.  He  is  convinced  he  will 
be  able  to  guard  Boris;  but  the  very  utmost  he  will  be  able  to 
do  is  to  observe  him.  We  have  already  seen  Bernard  change; 
passions  may  come  which  will  modify  him  still  more.  I  find  in 
a  note-book  a  sentence  or  two  in  which  I  have  written  down 
what  I  thought  of  him  some  time  ago: 

"I  ought  to  have  been  mistrustful  of  behaviour  as  excessive 
as  Bernard's  at  the  beginning  of  his  story.  It  seems  to  me,  to 
judge  by  his  subsequent  state,  that  this  behaviour  exhausted  all 
his  reserves  of  anarchy,  which  would  no  doubt  have  been  kept 
replenished  if  he  had  continued  to  vegetate,  as  is  fitting,  in  the 
midst  of  his  family's  oppression.  And  from  that  time  onwards 
his  life  was,  so  to  speak,  a  reaction  and  a  protest  against  this 
original  action.  The  habit  he  had  formed  of  rebellion  and  op- 
position incited  him  to  rebel  against  his  very  rebellion.  With- 
out a  doubt  not  one  of  my  heroes  has  disappointed  me  more 
than  he,  for  perhaps  there  was  not  one  who  had  given  me  greater 
hopes.  Perhaps  he  gave  way  too  early  to  his  own  bent." 

But  this  does  not  seem  very  true  to  me  any  longer.  I  think 
we  ought  to  allow  him  a  little  more  credit.  There  is  a  great 
deal  of  generosity  in  him;  virility  too  and  strength;  he  is  ca- 
pable of  indignation.  He  enjoys  hearing  himself  talk  a  little  too 
much;  but  it's  a  fact  that  he  talks  well.  I  mistrust  feelings  that 
find  their  expression  too  quickly.  He  is  very  good  at  his  studies. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  204 

but  new  feelings  do  not  easily  fill  forms  that  have  been  learnt 
by  heart.  A  little  invention  would  make  him  stammer.  He  has 
already  read  too  much,  remembered  too  much,  and  learnt  a 
great  deal  more  from  books  than  from  life. 

I  cannot  console  myself  for  the  turn  of  chance  which  made 
him  take  Olivier's  place  beside  Edouard.  Events  fell  out  badly. 
It  was  Olivier  that  Edouard  loved.  With  what  care  he  would 
have  ripened  him!  With  what  lover-like  respect  he  would  have 
guided,  supported,  raised  him  to  his  own  level!  Passavant  will 
ruin  him  to  a  certainty.  Nothing  could  be  more  pernicious  for 
him  than  to  be  enveloped  in  so  unscrupulous  an  atmosphere.  I 
had  hoped  that  Olivier  would  have  defended  himself  a  little 
better;  but  his  is  a  tender  nature  and  sensitive  to  flattery. 
Everything  goes  to  his  head.  Moreover  I  seem  to  gather  from 
certain  accents  in  his  letter  to  Bernard  that  he  is  a  little  vain. 
Sensuality,  pique,  vanity — to  what  does  not  all  this  lay  him 
open?  When  Edouard  finds  him  again,  I  very  much  fear  it 
will  be  too  late.  But  he  is  still  young  and  one  has  the  right  to 
hope. 

Passavant  .  .  .  ?  best  not  speak  of  him,  I  think.  Nothing 
spreads  more  ruin  or  receives  more  applause  than  men  of  his 
stamp — unless  it  be  women  like  Lady  Griffith.  At  the  begin- 
ning, I  must  confess,  she  rather  took  me  in.  But  I  soon  recog- 
nized my  mistake.  People  like  her  are  cut  out  of  a  cloth  which 
has  no  thickness.  America  exports  a  great  many  of  them,  but 
is  not  the  only  country  to  breed  them.  Fortune,  intelligence, 
beauty — they  seem  to  possess  everything,  except  a  soul.  Vincent, 
we  may  be  sure,  will  soon  find  it  out.  No  past  weighs  upon 
them — no  constraint;  they  have  neither  laws,  nor  masters,  nor 
scruples;  by  their  freedom  and  spontaneity,  they  make  the  nov- 
elist's despair;  he  can  get  nothing  from  them  but  worthless 
reactions.  I  hope  not  to  see  Lady  Griffith  again  for  a  long  time 
to  come.  I  am  sorry  she  has  carried  off  Vincent,  who  interested 
me  more,  but  who  becomes  commonplace  by  frequenting  her. 
Rolling  in  her  wake,  he  loses  his  angles.  It's  a  pity;  he  had 
rather  fine  ones. 

If  it  ever  happens  to  me  to  invent  another  story,  I  shall

allow  only  well-tempered  characters  to  inhabit  it — characters 
that  life,  instead  of  blunting,  sharpens.  Laura,  Douviers,  La 
Perouse,  Azais  .  .  .  what  is  to  be  done  with  such  people  as 
these?  It  was  not  I  who  sought  them  out;  while  following  Ber- 
nard and  Olivier  I  found  them  in  my  path.  So  much  the  worse 
for  me;  henceforth  it  is  my  duty  to  attend  them. 


THIRD  PART 
PARIS 


When  we  are  in  possession  of  a  few  more 
local  monographs — then,  and  only  then,  by 
grouping  their  data,  by  minutely  confront- 
ing and  comparing  them,  we  shall  be  able  to 
re-consider  the  subject  as  a  whole,  and  take 
a  new  and  decisive  step  forward.  To  proceed 
otherwise,  would  be  merely  to  start,  armed 
with  two  or  three  rough  and  simple  ideas,  on 
a  kind  of  rapid  excursion.  It  would  be,  in 
most  cases,  to  pass  by  everything  that  is 
particular,  individual,  irregular— that  is  to 
say,  everything,  on  the  whole,  that  is  most 
interesting.

EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:  OSCAR  MOLINIER 

Son  retour  a  Paris  ne  lui  causa  point  de 
plaisir. 

Flaubert:  L' Education  Sentimentale. 

Sept.  22nd. — Hot;  bored.  Have  come  back  to  Paris  a  week  too 
soon.  My  eagerness  always  makes  me  respond  before  I  am 
summoned.  Curiosity  rather  than  zeal;  desire  to  anticipate.  I 
have  never  been  able  to  come  to  terms  with  my  thirst. 

Took  Boris  to  see  his  grandfather.  Sophroniska,  who  had  been 
the  day  before  to  prepare  him,  tells  me  that  Madame  de  La 
Pejrouse  has  gone  into  the  home.  Heavens!  What  a  relief! 

I  left  the  little  boy  on  the  landing,  after  ringing  the  bell, 
thinking  it  would  be  more  discreet  not  to  be  present  at  the  first 
meeting;  I  was  afraid  of  the  old  fellow's  thanks.  Questioned  the 
boy  later  on,  but  could  get  nothing  out  of  him.  Sophroniska, 
when  I  saw  her  later,  told  me  he  had  not  said  anything  to  her 
either.  When  she  went  to  fetch  him  after  an  hour's  interval,  as 
had  been  arranged,  a  maid-servant  opened  the  door;  she  found 
the  old  gentleman  sitting  in  front  of  a  game  of  draughts  and 
the  child  sulking  by  himself  in  a  corner  at  the  other  end  of  the 
room. 

"It's  odd,"  said  La  Perouse,  very  much  out  of  countenance, 
"he  seemed  to  be  amused,  but  all  of  a  sudden  he  got  tired  of  it. 
I  am  afraid  he  is  a  little  wanting  in  patience." 

It  was  a  mistake  to  leave  them  alone  together  too  long. 

Sept.  27th. — This  morning  met  Molinier  under  the  arcades 
of  the  Odeon.  Pauline  and  George  are  not  coming  back  till  the 
day  after  to-morrow.  If  Molinier,  who  has  been  by  himself  in 
Paris  since  yesterday,  was  as  bored  as  I  am,  it's  no  wonder  that 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  210 

he  seemed  enchanted  to  see  me.  We  went  and  sat  down  in  the 
Luxembourg,  till  it  should  be  time  for  lunch,  and  agreed  to 
take  it  together. 

Molinier,  when  he  is  with  me,  affects  a  rather  jocose — even, 
at  times,  a  kind  of  rakish  tone — which  he  no  doubt  thinks  the 
correct  thing  to  please  an  artist.  A  desire  too  to  show  that  he  is 
still  full  of  beans. 

"At  heart,"  he  declared,  "I  am  a  passionate  man."  I  under- 
stand that  what  he  really  meant  was  that  he  was  a  libidinous 
one.  I  smiled,  as  one  would  if  one  heard  a  woman  declare  she 
had  very  fine  legs — a  smile  which  signifies  "I  never  doubted  it 
for  a  moment."  Until  that  day  1  had  only  seen  the  magistrate; 
the  man  at  last  threw  aside  his  toga. 

I  waited  till  we  were  seated  at  table  at  Foyot's  before  speaking 
to  him  of  Olivier;  1  told  him  that  I  had  recently  had  news  of 
him  through  one  of  his  schoolfellows,  and  that  I  had  heard 
he  was  travelling  in  Corsica  with  the  Comte  de  Passavant. 

"Yes,  he's  a  friend  of  Vincent's:  he  offered  to  take  him  with 
him.  As  Olivier  had  just  passed  his  hachot  rather  brilliantly,  his 
mother  thought  it  would  be  hard  to  refuse  him  such  a  pleasure. 
.  .  .  The  Comte  de  Passavant  is  a  writer.  1  expect  you  know 
him." 

I  did  not  conceal  that  I  had  no  great  liking  for  either  his 
books  or  his  person. 

"Amongst  confreres  one  is  sometimes  apt  to  be  a  little  severe 
in  one's  judgments,"  he  retorted.  "I  tried  to  read  his  last  novel; 
certain  critics  think  very  highly  of  it.  I  didn't  see  much  in  it 
myself;  but  it's  not  my  line,  you  know.  .  .  ."  Then  as  I  ex- 
pressed my  fear  as  to  the  influence  Passavant  might  have  over 
Olivier: 

"In  reality,"  he  added  in  his  rather  woolly  way,  "I  personally 
didn't  approve  of  this  expedition.  But  it's  no  good  not  realizing 
that  when  they  get  to  a  certain  age  our  children  escape  from 
our  control.  It's  in  the  nature  of  things  and  there's  nothing 
to  be  done.  Pauline  would  like  to  go  on  hanging  over  them  for 
ever.  She's  like  all  mothers.  I  sometimes  say  to  her:  'But  you 
worry  your  sons  to  death.  Leave  them  alone.  It's  you  who  put 


211  OSCAR   MOLINIER 

things  into  their  heads  with  all  your  questions.  .  .  .'  For  my 
part  I  consider  it  does  no  good  to  watch  over  them  too  long. 
The  important  thing  is  that  a  few  good  principles  should  be  in- 
culcated into  them  during  their  early  education.  The  important 
thing  above  all  is  that  they  should  come  of  a  good  stock. 
Heredity,  my  dear  friend,  heredity  triumphs  over  everything. 
There  are  certain  bad  lots  whom  nothing  can  improve — the 
predestined,  we  call  them.  Those  must  have  a  tight  hand  kept 
over  them.  But  when  one  has  to  do  with  well-conditioned  na- 
tures, one  can  let  them  go  a  bit  easy." 

"But  you  were  telling  me,"  I  insisted,  "that  you  didn't  ap- 
prove of  Olivier's  being  carried  off  in  this  way." 

"Oh!  approve  .  .  .  approve!"  he  said  with  his  nose  in  his 
plate,  "there's  no  need  for  my  approval.  There  are  many  house- 
holds, you  know — and  those  the  most  united — where  it  isn't 
always  the  husband  who  settles  things.  But  you  aren't  married; 
such  things  don't  interest  you.  .  .  ." 

"Oh!"  said  I,  laughing,  "but  I'm  a  novelist." 

"Then  you  have  no  doubt  remarked  that  it  isn't  always  from 
weakness  of  character  that  a  man  allows  himself  to  be  led  by 
his  wife." 

"Yes,"  I  conceded  by  way  of  flattery,  "there  are  strong  and 
even  dominating  men  whom  one  discovers  to  be  of  a  lamb-like 
docility  in  their  married  life." 

"And  do  you  know  why?"  he  went  on.  "Nine  times  out  of  ten, 
when  the  husband  submits  to  his  wife,  it  is  because  he  has  some- 
thing to  be  forgiven  him.  A  virtuous  woman,  my  dear  fellow, 
takes  advantage  of  everything.  If  the  man  stoops  for  a  second, 
there  she  is  sitting  on  his  shoulders.  Oh!  we  poor  husbands  are 
sometimes  greatly  to  be  pitied.  When  we  are  young,  our  one 
wish  is  to  have  chaste  wives,  without  a  thought  of  how  much 
their  virtue  is  going  to  cost  us." 

I  gazed  at  Molinier,  sitting  there  with  his  elbows  on  the  table 
and  his  chin  in  his  hands.  The  poor  man  little  suspected  how 
naturally  his  backbone  fell  into  the  stooping  attitude  of  which 
he  complained;  he  kept  mopping  his  forehead,  ate  a  great 
deal — not   like  a  gourmet,   but   like  a  glutton — and   seemed 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  212 

particularly  to  appreciate  the  old  Burgundy  which  we  had  or- 
dered. Happy  to  feel  himself  listened  to,  understood,  and,  no 
doubt  he  thought,  approved,  he  overflowed  in  confessions. 

"In  my  capacity  as  magistrate,"  he  continued,  "I  have  known 
women  who  only  lent  themselves  to  their  husbands  against  the 
grain  of  their  heart  and  senses  .  .  .  and  who  yet  are  indignant 
when  the  poor  wretch  who  has  been  repulsed,  seeks  his  prov- 
ender elsewhere." 

The  magistrate  had  begun  his  sentence  in  the  past;  the  hus- 
band finished  it  in  the  present,  with  an  unmistakable  allusion 
to  himself.  He  added  sententiously  between  two  mouthfuls: 

"Other  people's  appetites  easily  appear  excessive  when  one 
doesn't  share  them."  He  drank  a  long  draught  of  wine,  then: 
"And  this  explains,  my  dear  friend,  how  a  husband  loses  the 
direction  of  his  household." 

I  understood,  indeed — it  was  clear  under  the  apparent  inco- 
herence of  his  talk — his  desire  to  make  the  responsibility  of 
his  own  shortcomings  fall  upon  his  wife's  virtue.  Creatures  as 
disjointed  as  this  puppet,  1  said  to  myself,  need  every  scrap  of 
their  egoism  to  bind  together  the  disconnected  elements  of  which 
they  are  formed.  A  moment's  self-forgetfulness,  and  they  would 
fall  to  pieces.  He  was  silent.  I  felt  I  must  pour  a  few  reflec- 
tions over  him,  as  one  pours  oil  on  an  engine  that  has  ac- 
complished a  bout  of  work;  and  to  set  him  going  again  I  re- 
marked: 

"Fortunately  Pauline  is  intelligent." 

He  prolonged  his  "ye-e-s"  till  it  turned  into  a  query;  then: 

"But  still  there  are  things  she  doesn't  understand.  However 
intelligent  a  woman  may  be,  you  know  .  .  .  Still,  I  must  ad- 
mit that  in  the  circumstances  I  didn't  manage  very  cleverly.  I 
began  telling  her  about  a  little  afi'air  of  mine  at  a  time  when  I 
thought — when  I  was  absolutely  convinced — that  it  wouldn't 
go  any  further.  It  did  go  further  .  .  .  and  Pauline's  suspicions 
too.  It  was  a  mistake  to  put  her  on  the  'qui  vive,'  as  people  say. 
I  have  been  obliged  to  hide  things  from  her — to  tell  lies.  .  .  . 
That's  what  comes  of  not  holding  one's  tongue  to  begin  with. 
It's  not  my  fault.  I'm  naturally  confiding.  .  .  .  But  Pauline's 


213  OSCAR   MOLINIER 

jealousy  is  alarming.  You  can't  imagine  how  careful  1  have 
had  to  be." 

"Was  it  long  ago?"  I  asked. 

"Oh,  it's  been  going  on  for  about  five  years  now;  and  I 
flatter  myself  I  had  completely  reassured  her.  But  now  the 
whole  thing  has  to  begin  all  over  again.  What  do  you  think! 
When  I  got  back  home  the  day  before  yesterday  .  .  .  Suppose 
we  order  another  bottle  of  Pommard,  eh?" 

"Not  for  me,  please." 

"Perhaps  I  could  have  a  half  bottle.  I'll  go  home  and  take  a 
little  nap  after  lunch.  I  feel  this  heat  so.  .  .  .  Well,  I  was 
telling  you  that  the  day  before  yesterday,  when  I  got  back,  I 
went  to  my  writing  desk  to  put  some  papers  away.  1  pulled  open 
the  drawer  where  I  had  hidden  .  .  .  the  person  in  question's 
letters.  Imagine  my  stupefaction,  my  dear  fellow;  the  drawer 
was  empty!  Deuce  take  it!  I  see  exactly  what  has  happened; 
about  a  fortnight  ago,  Pauline  came  up  to  Paris  with  George,  to 
go  to  the  wedding  of  the  daughter  of  one  of  my  colleagues.  I 
wasn't  able  to  attend  it  myself;  I  was  away  in  Holland.  .  .  . 
And  besides,  functions  of  that  kind  are  women's  business.  Well, 
there  she  was,  with  nothing  to  do,  in  an  empty  flat;  under  pre- 
tence of  putting  things  straight  .  .  .  you  know  what  women 
are  like — always  rather  curious  ...  she  began  nosing  about 
.  .  .  oh!  intending  no  ill — I'm  not  blaming  her.  But  Pauline 
has  always  had  a  perfect  mania  for  tidying.  .  .  .  Well,  what  on 
earth  am  I  to  say  to  her,  now  that  she's  got  all  the  proofs?  If 
only  the  silly  little  thing  didn't  call  me  by  my  Christian  name! 
Such  a  united  couple!  When  I  think  what  I'm  in  for!  .  .  ." 

The  poor  man  stuck  in  the  slough  of  his  confidences.  He 
dabbed  his  forehead — fanned  himself.  I  had  drunk  much  less 
than  he.  The  heart  does  not  furnish  compassion  at  command;  I 
merely  felt  disgust  for  him.  I  could  put  up  with  him  as  the 
father  of  a  family  (though  it  was  painful  to  me  to  think  that  he 
was  Olivier's  father),  as  a  respectable,  honest,  retired  bourgeois; 
but  as  a  man  in  love,  I  could  only  imagine  him  ridiculous.  I 
was  especially  made  uncomfortable  by  the  clumsiness  and  triv- 
iality of  his  words,  of  his  pantomime;  neither  his  face  nor  his 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  214 

voice  seemed  suited  to  the  feelings  he  expressed;  it  was  like  a 
double  bass  trying  to  produce  the  effects  of  an  alto;  his  instru- 
ment brought  out  nothing  but  squeaks. 

"You  said  that  she  had  George  with  her.  .  .  ." 

"Yes;  she  didn't  want  to  leave  him  at  the  sea-side  alone.  But 
naturally  in  Paris  he  wasn't  in  her  pocket  the  whole  time.  .  .  . 
Why,  my  dear  fellow,  in  twenty-six  years  of  married  life  I  have 
never  had  the  smallest  scene,  the  slightest  altercation.  .  .  . 
When  I  think  of  what's  in  store  for  me!  .  .  .  for  Pauline's  com- 
ing back  in  two  days.  ...  Oh!  I  say,  let's  talk  of  something 
else.  Well,  what  do  you  think  of  Vincent?  The  Prince  of  Mo- 
naco— a  cruise.  ...  By  Jove!  .  .  .  What!  didn't  you  know? 
.  .  .  Yes;  he  has  gone  out  in  charge  of  soundings  and  deep- 
sea  fishing  near  the  Azores.  Ah!  there's  no  need  to  be  anxious 
about  him,  I  assure  you.  He'll  make  his  way  all  right,  without 
help  from  anyone." 

"His  health?" 

"Completely  restored.  With  his  intelligence,  I  think  he  is  on 
the  high  road  to  becoming  famous.  The  Comte  de  Passavant 
made  no  bones  about  saying  that  he  considered  him  one  of  the 
most  remarkable  men  he  ever  met.  He  even  said  'the  most  re- 
markable' .  ,  .  but  one  must  make  allowances  for  exaggera- 
tion." 

The  meal  was  finished;  he  lit  a  cigar. 

"May  I  ask  you,"  he  went  on,  "who  the  friend  is  who  gave 
you  news  of  Olivier?  I  must  tell  you  that  I  attach  particular 
importance  to  the  company  my  children  keep.  I  consider  that 
it's  a  thing  it's  impossible  to  pay  too  much  attention  to.  My  sons 
fortunately  have  a  natural  tendency  to  make  friends  with  only 
the  best  people.  Vincent,  you  see,  with  his  prince;  Olivier  with 
the  Comte  de  Passavant.  ...  As  for  George,  he  has  been  go- 
ing about  at  Houlgate  with  one  of  his  schoolfellows — a  young 
Adamanti — he's  to  be  at  the  Vedel-Azais  school  next  term  too; 
a  boy  in  whom  one  can  have  complete  confidence;  his  father  is 
senator  for  Corsica.  But  just  see  how  prudent  one  has  to  be! 
Olivier  had  a  friend  who  seemed  to  belong  to  an  excellent  fam- 
ily— a  certain  Bernard  Profitendieu.  I  must  tell  you  that  old 


215  OSCAR   MOLINIER 

Profitendieu  is  a  colleague  of  mine;  a  most  distinguished  man. 
1  have  particular  esteem  for  him.  But  .  .  .  (between  ourselves) 
...  it  has  just  come  to  my  knowledge  that  he  is  not  the  father 
of  the  boy  who  bears  his  name!  What  do  you  say  to  that?" 

"Young  Bernard  Profitendieu  is  the  very  person  who  spoke 
to  me  about  Olivier,"  I  said. 

Molinier  drew  a  few  deep  puffs  from  his  cigar  and  raised  his 
eyebrows  very  high,  so  that  his  forehead  was  covered  with 
wrinkles: 

"I  had  rather  Olivier  saw  as  little  as  possible  of  that  young 
fellow.  I  have  heard  the  most  deplorable  things  about  him — not 
that  I'm  much  astonished  at  that.  We  must  admit  that  there's 
no  grounds  for  expecting  any  good  from  a  boy  who  has  been 
born  in  such  unfortunate  conditions.  I  don't  mean  to  say  that 
a  natural  child  mayn't  have  great  qualities — and  even  virtues; 
but  the  fruit  of  lawlessness  and  insubordination  must  necessarily 
be  tainted  with  the  germs  of  anarchy.  Yes,  my  dear  friend,  what 
was  bound  to  happen  has  happened.  Young  Bernard  has  sud- 
denly left  the  shelter  of  the  family  which  he  ought  never  to  have 
entered.  He  has  gone  "to  live  his  life,"  as  Emile  Augier  says; 
live  Heaven  knows  how  or  where.  Poor  Profitendieu,  when  he 
told  me  about  this  extravagant  behaviour,  seemed  exceedingly 
upset  about  it.  I  made  him  understand  that  he  ought  not  to 
take  it  so  much  to  heart.  In  reality  the  boy's  departure  puts 
everything  to  rights  again." 

I  protested  that  I  knew  Bernard  well  enough  to  vouch  for  his 
being  a  charming,  well-behaved  boy.  (Needless  to  say  I  took 
good  care  not  to  mention  the  affair  of  the  suit-case.)  But  Mo- 
linier only  went  on  all  the  more  vigorously. 

"So!  So!  I  see  I  must  tell  you  more." 

Then,  leaning  forward  and  speaking  in  a  whisper: 

"My  colleague  Profitendieu  has  recently  had  to  investigate 
an  exceedingly  shady  and  disagreeable  affair,  both  on  its  own 
account  and  because  of  the  scandalous  consequences  it  may  en- 
tail. It's  a  preposterous  story  and  one  would  be  only  too  glad 
if  one  could  disbelieve  it.  .  .  .  Imagine,  my  dear  fellow,  a 
regular  concern  of  organized  prostitution,  in  fact  of  a  ...  no. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  216 

I  don't  want  to  use  bad  words;  let's  say  a  tea-shop,  with  this 
particularly  scandalous  feature,  that  its  habitues  are  mostly, 
almost  exclusively,  very  young  schoolboys.  I  tell  you  it's  in- 
credible. The  children  certainly  don't  realize  the  gravity  of 
their  acts,  for  they  hardly  attempt  to  conceal  themselves.  It 
takes  place  when  they  come  out  of  school.  They  take  tea,  they 
talk,  they  amuse  themselves  with  the  ladies;  and  the  play  is 
carried  further  in  the  rooms  which  adjoin  the  tea  rooms.  Of 
course  not  everyone  is  allowed  in.  One  has  to  be  introduced, 
initiated.  Who  stands  the  expense  of  these  orgies?  Who  pays  the 
rent?  It  wouldn't  have  been  very  difficult  to  find  out;  but  the 
investigations  had  to  be  conducted  with  extreme  prudence,  for 
fear  of  learning  too  much,  of  being  carried  further  than  one 
meant,  of  being  forced  to  prosecute  and  compromise  the  respect- 
able families  whose  children  are  suspected  of  being  the  principal 
clients  of  the  affair.  I  did  what  I  could  therefore  to  moderate 
Profitendieu's  zeal.  He  charged  into  the  business  like  a  bull, 
without  suspecting  that  with  the  first  stroke  of  his  horns  .  .  . 
(oh!  I'm  sorry;  I  didn't  say  it  on  purpose;  ha!  ha!  ha!  how 
funny!  It  came  out  quite  unintentionally)  ...  he  ran  the  risk 
of  sticking  his  own  son.  Fortunately  the  holidays  broke  every- 
thing up.  The  schoolboys  were  scattered  and  I  hope  the  whole 
business  will  peter  out,  be  hushed  up  after  a  warning  or  so  and 
a  few  discreet  penalties." 

"Are  you  quite  sure  Bernard  Profitendieu  was  mixed  up 
in  it?" 

"Not  absolutely,  but  .  .  ." 

"What  makes  you  think  so?" 

"First,  the  fact  that  he  is  a  natural  child.  You  don't  suppose 
that  a  boy  of  his  age  runs  away  from  home  without  having 
touched  the  lowest  depths?  .  .  .  And  then  I  have  an  idea  that 
Profitendieu  was  seized  with  some  suspicions,  for  his  zeal  sud- 
denly cooled  down;  more  than  that,  he  seemed  to  be  backing 
out,  and  the  last  time  I  asked  him  how  the  affair  was  going  on 
he  seemed  embarrassed:  '1  think,  after  all  that  nothing  will 
come  of  it,'  he  said  and  hastily  changed  the  subject.  Poor 
Profitendieu!  I  must  say  he  doesn't  deserve  it.  He's  an  honest 


217  OSCAR   MOLINIER 

man,  and  what's  rarer  perhaps,  a  good  fellow.  By  the  way,  his 
daughter  has  just  married  exceedingly  well.  I  wasn't  able  to  go 
to  the  wedding  because  I  was  in  Holland,  but  Pauline  and 
George  came  back  on  purpose.  Did  I  tell  you  that  before?  It's 
time  I  went  and  had  my  nap.  .  .  .  What!  really?  You  want  to 
pay  it  all?  No,  no!  You  mustn't.  Bachelors — old  friends — go 
shares.  ...  No  use?  Well!  well!  Good-bye!  Don't  forget  that 
Pauline  is  coming  back  in  two  days.  Come  and  see  us.  And  don't 
call  me  Molinier.  Won't  you  say  Oscar?  ...  I've  been  meaning 
to  ask  you  for  a  long  time." 

This  evening  a  note  from  Rachel,  Laura's  sister: 

"I  have  something  very  serious  to  say  to  you.  Could  you, 
without  inconvenience,  look  in  at  the  school  to-morrow  after- 
noon? It  would  be  doing  me  a  great  service." 

If  she  had  wanted  to  speak  about  Laura,  she  wouldn't  have 
waited  so  long.  This  is  the  first  time  she  has  written  to  me. 


EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:  AT  THE  VEDELS' 

Sept.  28th. — I  found  Rachel  standing  at  the  door  of  the  big 
class-room  on  the  ground  floor.  Two  servants  were  washing  the 
boards.  She  herself  had  a  servant's  apron  on  and  was  holding  a 
duster  in  her  hand. 

"I  knew  I  could  count  on  you,"  she  said,  holding  out  her  hand 
with  a  look  on  her  face  of  tender,  resigned  sadness,  and  yet  a 
look  that  was  smiling  too,  and  more  touching  than  beauty  itself. 
"If  you  aren't  in  too  great  a  hurry,  the  best  thing  would  be  for 
you  first  to  go  up  and  pay  grandfather  a  little  visit,  and  then 
Mamma.  If  they  heard  you  had  been  here  without  seeing  them, 
they  would  be  hurt.  But  keep  a  little  time  for  me;  I  simply 
must  speak  to  you.  You  will  find  me  here;  you  see,  I  am  super- 
intending the  maids'  work." 

Out  of  a  kind  of  modesty,  she  never  says  "my  work."  Rachel 
has  effaced  herself  all  her  life  and  nothing  could  be  more  dis- 
creet, more  retiring  than  her  virtue.  Abnegation  is  so  natural 
to  her,  that  not  one  of  her  family  is  grateful  to  her  for  her  per- 
petual self-sacrifice.  She  has  the  most  beautiful  woman's  nature 
that  I  know. 

I  went  up  to  the  second  floor  to  see  old  Azais.  He  hardly  ever 
leaves  his  arm-chair  nowadays.  He  made  me  sit  down  beside 
him  and  began  talking  about  La  Perouse  almost  at  once. 

"It  makes  me  feel  anxious  to  know  that  he  is  living  all  alone, 
and  I  should  like  to  persuade  him  to  come  and  stay  here.  We  are 
old  friends,  you  know.  I  went  to  see  him  the  other  day.  I  am 
afraid  he  has  been  very  much  afi"ected  by  his  dear  wife's  leaving 
him  to  go  to  Sainte  Ferine.  His  maid  told  me  he  hardly  eats 
anything.  I  consider  that  as  a  rule  we  eat  too  much;  but  there 
should  be  moderation  in  all  things  and  we  should  avoid  excess 


219  AT  THE   VEDELS' 

in  both  directions.  He  thinks  it  useless  to  have  things  cooked 
only  for  him;  but  if  he  took  his  meals  with  us,  seeing  others 
eat  would  encourage  him  to  do  the  same.  Moreover,  he  would 
be  with  his  charming  little  grandson,  whom  he  would  otherwise 
see  very  little  of;  for  Rue  Vavin  is  quite  a  long  journey  away 
from  the  Faubourg  St.  Honore.  And  moreover,  I  shouldn't  much 
care  to  let  the  child  go  out  by  himself  in  Paris.  I  have  known 
Anatole  de  La  Perouse  for  a  long  time.  He  was  always  ec- 
centric. I  don't  mean  it  as  a  reproach,  but  he  is  a  little  proud 
by  nature,  and  perhaps  he  wouldn't  accept  my  hospitality  with- 
out wishing  to  make  some  return.  So  I  thought  I  might  propose 
that  he  should  take  school  preparation;  it  wouldn't  be  tiring, 
and  moreover  it  would  have  the  advantage  of  distracting  him, 
of  taking  him  out  of  himself  a  little.  He  is  a  good  mathema- 
tician, and  if  necessary  he  might  give  algebra  and  geometry  les- 
sons. Now  that  he  has  no  pupils  left,  his  furniture  and  his  piano 
are  of  no  use  to  him;  he  ought  to  give  notice;  and  as  coming 
here  would  save  his  rent,  I  thought  we  might  agree  on  a  little 
sum  for  his  board  and  lodging,  to  put  him  more  at  his  ease,  so 
that  he  shouldn't  feel  himself  too  much  under  an  obligation  to 
me.  You  ought  to  try  and  persuade  him — and  without  much 
delay,  for  with  his  poor  style  of  living,  I  am  afraid  he  may 
soon  become  too  enfeebled.  Moreover,  the  boys  are  coming 
back  in  two  days;  so  it  would  be  a  good  thing  to  know  how  the 
matter  stands  and  whether  we  may  count  on  him — as  he  may 
count  on  us." 

I  promised  to  speak  to  La  Perouse  the  following  day.  As  if 
relieved,  he  went  on  at  once: 

"Oh!  by  the  bye,  what  a  good  fellow  your  young  protege 
Bernard  is!  He  has  kindly  offered  to  make  himself  useful  to  us; 
he  spoke  of  taking  preparation  in  the  lower  school;  but  I'm 
afraid  he's  rather  young  himself  and  perhaps  he  might  not  be 
able  to  keep  order.  I  talked  to  him  for  a  long  time  and  found 
him  most  attractive.  He  is  the  metal  out  of  which  the  best 
Christians  are  forged.  It  is  assuredly  to  be  regretted  that  an 
unfortunate  early  education  has  turned  aside  his  soul  from  the 
true  path.  He  confessed  that  he  was  without  faith;  but  the  tone 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  220 

in  which  he  said  so  filled  me  with  hope.  I  replied  that  I  trusted 
I  should  find  in  him  all  the  qualities  that  go  to  the  making  of 
a  good  little  Christian  soldier,  and  that  he  ought  to  devote  him- 
self to  the  increase  of  those  talents  which  God  had  vouchsafed 
to  grant  him.  We  read  the  parable  together  and  I  think  the  seed 
has  not  fallen  on  bad  ground.  He  seemed  moved  by  my  words 
and  promised  to  reflect  on  them." 

Bernard  had  already  given  me  an  account  of  this  interview; 
I  knew  what  he  thought  of  it,  so  that  I  felt  the  conversation 
becoming  a  little  painful.  I  had  already  got  up  to  go,  but  old 
Azais,  keeping  the  hand  I  held  out  to  him  in  both  his,  went  on : 

"Oh!  by  the  bye.  I  have  seen  our  Laura.  I  know  the  dear  child 
passed  a  whole  delightful  month  with  you  in  the  mountains;  it 
seems  to  have  done  her  a  great  deal  of  good.  I  am  happy  to 
think  she  is  with  her  husband  once  more;  he  must  have  been 
beginning  to  suffer  from  her  long  absence.  It  is  regrettable  that 
his  work  would  not  allow  of  his  joining  you." 

I  was  pulling  away  my  hand  to  leave,  more  and  more  em- 
barrassed, for  I  didn't  know  what  Laura  might  have  said,  but 
with  a  sudden  commanding  gesture  he  drew  me  towards  him, 
and  bending  forward,  whispered  in  my  ear: 

"Laura  confided  her  hopes  to  me;  but  hush!  .  .  .  She  prefers 
it  not  to  be  known  yet.  I  mention  it  to  you  because  I  know 
that  you  are  in  the  secret  and  because  we  are  both  discreet.  The 
poor  child  was  quite  abashed  when  she  told  me  and  blushed 
deeply;  she  is  so  reserved.  As  she  had  gone  down  on  her  knees 
before  me,  we  thanked  God  together  for  having,  in  His  good- 
ness, blessed  their  union." 

I  think  that  Laura  might  have  put  off  this  confidence,  which 
her  condition  doesn't  as  yet  necessitate.  Had  she  consulted  me,  I 
should  have  told  her  to  wait  until  she  had  seen  Douviers  be- 
fore saying  anything.  Azais  can't  see  an  inch  in  front  of  his 
nose,  but  the  rest  of  the  family  will  not  be  taken  in  so  easily. 

The  old  fellow  went  on  to  execute  a  few  further  variations  on 
diverse  pastoral  themes;  then  he  told  me  his  daughter  would 
be  happy  to  see  me  and  I  went  downstairs  to  the  Vedels'  floor. 


221  AT  THE  VEDELS' 

Just  re-read  the  above.  In  speaking  so  of  Azais,  it  is  myself 
that  I  render  odious.  I  am  fully  aware  of  it,  and  add  these  few 
lines  for  Bernard's  sake,  in  case  his  charming  indiscretion  leads 
him  to  poke  his  nose  again  into  this  note-book.  He  has  only  to 
go  on  frequenting  him  a  little  longer  in  order  to  understand 
what  I  mean.  I  like  the  old  fellow  very  much,  and  "moreover," 
as  he  says,  I  respect  him;  but  when  I  am  with  him  I  have  the 
greatest  difficulty  in  containing  myself;  this  doesn't  tend  to 
make  me  enjoy  his  society. 

I  like  his  daughter,  the  pastoress,  very  much.  Madame  Vedel 
is  like  Lamartine's  Elvire — an  elderly  Elvire.  Her  conversation 
is  not  without  charm.  She  has  a  frequent  habit  of  leaving  her 
sentences  unfinished,  which  gives  her  reflections  a  kind  of  poetic 
vagueness.  She  reaches  the  infinite  by  way  of  the  indeterminate 
and  the  indefinite.  She  expects  from  a  future  life  all  that  is  lack- 
ing to  her  in  this  one;  this  enables  her  to  enlarge  her  hopes 
boundlessly.  The  very  narrowness  of  her  taking-off  ground  adds 
strength  to  her  impetus.  Seeing  Vedel  so  rarely  enables  her  to 
imagine  that  she  loves  him.  The  worthy  man  is  incessantly  on 
the  go,  in  request  on  all  sides,  taken  up  by  a  hundred  and  one 
different  ploys — sermons,  congresses,  visits  to  the  sick,  visits  to 
the  poor.  He  can  only  shake  your  hand  in  passing,  but  it  is  with 
all  the  greater  cordiality. 

"Too  busy  to  talk  to-day." 

"Never  mind;  we  shall  meet  again  in  Heaven,"  say  I;  but  he 
hasn't  had  time  to  hear  me. 

"Not  a  moment  to  himself,"  sighs  Madame  Vedel.  "If  you 
only  knew  the  things  he  gets  put  on  his  shoulders  now  that  .  .  . 
As  people  know  that  he  never  refuses  anything,  everyone  .  .  . 
When  he  comes  home  at  night,  he  is  sometimes  so  tired  that  I 
hardly  dare  speak  to  him  for  fear  of  ...  He  gives  so  much  of 
himself  to  others  that  there's  nothing  left  for  his  own  family." 

And  while  she  was  speaking  I  remembered  some  of  Vedel's 
home-comings  at  the  time  I  was  staying  at  the  pension.  I  some- 
times saw  him  take  his  head  between  his  hands  and  pant  aloud 
for  a  little  respite.  But  even  then  I  used  to  think  he  feared  a 
respite  even  more  than  he  longed  for  it,  and  that  nothing  more 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  .    222 

painful  could  have  been  accorded  him  than  a  little  time  in 
which  to  reflect. 

"You'll  take  a  cup  of  tea,  won't  you?"  asked  Madame  Vedel, 
as  a  little  maid  brought  in  a  loaded  tray. 

"There's  not  enough  sugar,  Ma'am." 

"Haven't  I  said  that  you  must  tell  Miss  Rachel  about  it? 
Quick!  .  .  .  Have  you  let  the  young  gentlemen  know  tea's 
ready?" 

"Mr.  Bernard  and  Mr.  Boris  have  gone  out." 

"Oh!  And  Mr.  Armand?  .  .  .  Make  haste." 

Then,  without  waiting  for  the  maid  to  leave  the  room: 

"The  poor  girl  has  just  arrived  from  Strasburg.  She  has  no 
.  .  .  She  has  to  be  told  everything.  .  .  .  Well!  What  are  you 
waiting  for  now?" 

The  maid-servant  turned  round  like  a  serpent  whose  tail  has 
been  trodden  on : 

"The  tutor's  downstairs;  he  wanted  to  come  up.  He  says  he 
won't  go  till  he's  been  paid." 

Madame  Vedel's  features  assumed  an  air  of  tragic  boredom: 

"How  many  times  must  I  repeat  that  I  have  nothing  to  do 
with  settling  accounts.  Tell  him  to  go  to  Miss  Rachel.  Go 
along.  .  .  .  Not  a  moment's  peace!  What  can  Rachel  be  think- 
ing of?" 

"Aren't  we  going  to  wait  tea  for  her?" 

"She  never  takes  tea.  .  .  .Oh!  the  beginning  of  term  is 
a  troublesome  time  for  us.  The  tutors  who  apply  ask  exorbi- 
tant fees,  or  when  their  fees  are  possible,  they  themselves  aren't. 
Papa  was  not  at  all  pleased  with  the  last;  he  was  a  great  deal 
too  weak  with  him;  and  now  he  comes  threatening.  You  heard 
what  the  maid  said.  All  these  people  think  of  nothing  but 
money.  ...  As  if  there  were  nothing  more  important  than  that 
in  the  world.  ...  In  the  mean  time  we  don't  know  how  to  re- 
place him.  Prosper  always  thinks  one  has  nothing  to  do  but  to 
pray  to  God  for  everything  to  go  right.  .  .  ." 

The  maid  came  back  with  the  sugar. 

"Have  you  told  Mr.  Armand?" 

"Yes,  Ma'am;  he's  coming  directly." 


223  AT  THE  VEDELS' 

"And  Sarah?"  I  asked. 

"She  won't  be  back  for  another  two  days.  She's  staying  with 
friends  in  England;  with  the  parents  of  the  girl  you  saw  here 
before  the  holidays.  They  have  been  very  kind,  and  I'm  glad 
that  Sarah  was  able  to  .  .  .  And  Laura.  I  thought  she  was 
looking  much  better.  The  stay  in  Switzerland  coming  after  the 
South  has  done  her  a  great  deal  of  good,  and  it  was  very  kind 
of  you  to  persuade  her  to  it.  It's  only  poor  Armand  who  hasn't 
left  Paris  all  the  holidays." 

"And  Rachel?" 

"Yes,  of  course;  Rachel  too.  She  had  a  great  many  invita- 
tions, but  she  preferred  to  stop  in  Paris.  And  then  Grandfather 
needed  her.  Besides  one  doesn't  always  do  what  one  wants  in 
this  life — as  I  am  obliged  to  repeat  to  the  children  now  and 
then.  One  must  think  of  other  people.  Do  you  suppose  I 
shouldn't  have  enjoyed  going  away  for  a  change  to  Switzerland 
too?  And  Prosper?  When  he  travels,  do  you  suppose  it's  for 
his  pleasure?  .  .  .  Armand,  you  know  I  don't  like  you  to 
come  in  here  without  a  collar  on,"  she  added,  as  she  saw  her 
son  enter  the  room. 

"My  dear  mother,  you  religiously  taught  me  to  attach  no 
importance  to  my  personal  appearance,"  said  he,  offering  me 
his  hand;  "and  with  eminent  a  propos  too,  as  the  wash  doesn't 
come  home  till  Tuesday  and  all  the  rest  of  my  collars  are  in 
rags." 

I  remembered  what  Olivier  had  told  me  about  his  school- 
fellow, and  it  seemed  to  me  that  he  was  right  and  that  an  ex- 
pression of  profound  anxiety  lay  hidden  beneath  the  spiteful 
irony  he  affected.  Armand's  face  had  fined  down;  his  nose  was 
pinched;  it  curved  hawk-like  over  lips  which  had  grown  thin 
and  colourless.  He  went  on : 

"Have  you  informed  your  noble  visitor  that  we  have  made 
several  additions  to  our  usual  company  of  performers  and 
engaged  a  few  sensational  stars  for  the  opening  of  the  winter 
season?  The  son  of  a  distinguished  senator  and  the  Vicomte  de 
Passavant,  brother  to  the  illustrious  writer — without  counting 
two  recruits  whom  you  know  already,  but  who  are  all  the  more 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  224 

honourable  on  that  account — Prince  Boris  and  the  Marquis  de 
Profitendieu — besides  some  others  whose  titles  and  virtues  re- 
main to  be  discovered." 

".You  see  he  hasn't  changed,"  said  the  poor  mother,  smiling 
at  these  witticisms. 

I  was  so  terribly  afraid  that  he  would  begin  to  talk  about 
Laura  that  I  cut  short  my  visit  and  went  downstairs  as  fast  as 
I  could  to  find  Rachel. 

She  had  turned  up  her  sleeves  to  help  in  the  arrangement  of 
the  class-room;  but  she  hastily  pulled  them  down  again  as  she 
saw  me  come  up. 

"It  is  extremely  painful  to  me  to  have  recourse  to  you,"  she 
began,  drawing  me  into  a  small  room  adjoining,  which  is  used 
for  private  lessons.  "I  meant  to  apply  to  Felix  Douviers — he 
asked  me  to;  but  now  that  I  have  seen  Laura,  I  understand  it's 
impossible.  .  .  ." 

She  was  very  pale,  and  as  she  said  these  last  words,  her  chin 
and  lips  quivered  so  convulsively  that  for  some  moments  she 
was  unable  to  speak.  I  looked  away  from  her,  in  the  fear  of 
adding  to  her  discomfort.  She  had  shut  the  door  and  was  leaning 
against  it.  I  tried  to  take  her  hand,  but  she  tore  it  away  from 
between  mine.  At  last  she  went  on  again  in  a  voice  that  seemed 
strangled  by  the  immensity  of  her  effort: 

"Can  you  lend  me  ten  thousand  francs?  The  term  promises 
to  be  fairly  good  and  I  hope  to  be  able  to  pay  you  back  soon." 

"When  do  you  want  it?" 

She  made  no  answer. 

"I  happen  to  have  a  little  over  a  thousand  francs  on  me," 
I  went  on.  "I  can  complete  the  sum  to-morrow  morning — this 
evening,  if  necessary." 

"No;  to-morrow  will  do.  But  if  you  can  let  me  have  a  thou- 
sand francs  at  once  without  inconvenience  .  .  ." 

I  took  out  my  pocket-book  and  handed  them  to  her. 

"Would  you  like  fourteen  hundred?" 

She  lowered  her  head  and  uttered  a  "yes"  so  faint  that  I  could 
hardly  hear  it,  then  she  tottered  to  a  school  bench,  dropped 
down  on  it,  and  with  her  elbows  leaning  on  the  desk  in  front  of 


225  AT  THE  VEDELS' 

her,  stayed  for  a  few  moments,  her  face  hidden  in  her  hands. 
I  thought  she  was  crying,  but  when  I  put  my  hand  on  her 
shoulder,  she  raised  her  head  and  I  saw  that  her  eyes  were  dry. 

"Rachel,"  I  said,  "don't  mind  having  had  to  ask  me  this;  I 
am  glad  to  be  able  to  oblige  you." 

She  looked  at  me  gravely: 

"What  is  painful  to  me  is  to  have  to  ask  you  not  to  mention 
it  either  to  Grandfather  or  to  Mamma.  Since  they  gave  the  ac- 
counts of  the  school  over  to  me,  I  have  let  them  think  that  .  .  . 
well,  they  don't  know.  Don't  say  anything,  I  beg  you.  Grand- 
father is  old  and  Mamma  takes  so  much  trouble." 

"Rachel,  it's  not  your  mother  who  takes  trouble.  .  .  .  It's 
you." 

"She  has  taken  trouble.  She's  tired  now.  It's  my  turn.  I  have 
nothing  else  to  do." 

It  was  quite  simply  that  she  said  these  simple  words.  I  felt 
no  bitterness  in  her  resignation — on  the  contrary,  a  kind  of 
serenity. 

"But  don't  imagine  that  things  are  worse  than  they  are.  It's 
just  a  difficult  moment  to  tide  over,  because  some  of  the  credi- 
tors are  getting  impatient." 

"I  heard  the  maid  just  now  mention  a  tutor  who  was  asking 
to  be  paid." 

"Yes;  he  came  and  had  a  very  painful  scene  with  Grand- 
father, which  unfortunately  I  was  unable  to  prevent.  He's  a 
brutal,  vulgar  man.  I  must  go  and  pay  him." 

"Would  you  like  me  to  do  it  for  you?" 

She  hesitated  a  moment,  trying  in  vain  to  force  a  smile. 

"Thank  you.  No;  I  had  better  do  it  myself.  .  .  .  But  come 
with  me,  will  you?  I'm  rather  frightened  of  him.  If  he  sees 
you,  he  won't  dare  say  anything." 

The  school  courtyard  is  separated  from  the  garden  by  two  or 
three  steps  and  a  balustrade,  against  which  the  tutor  was  lean- 
ing with  his  elbows  thrust  behind  him.  He  had  on  an  enormous 
soft  felt  hat  and  was  smoking  a  pipe.  While  Rachel  was  engag- 
ing him,  Armand  came  up  to  me. 

"Rachel  has  been  bleeding  you,"  he  said  cynically.  "You 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  226 

have  come  in  the  nick  of  time  to  save  her  from  a  horrid  anxiety. 
It's  Alexander — my  beast  of  a  brother,  who  has  been  getting 
into  debt  again  in  the  colonies.  She  wants  to  hide  it  from  my 
parents.  She  has  already  given  up  half  her  'dot'  to  make  Laura's 
a  little  larger;  but  this  time  all  the  rest  of  it  has  gone.  She 
didn't  tell  you  anything  about  that,  I  bet.  Her  modesty  ex- 
asperates me.  It's  one  of  the  most  sinister  jokes  in  this  world 
below  that  every  time  anyone  sacrifices  himself  for  others,  one 
may  be  perfectly  certain  he  is  worth  more  than  they.  .  .  .  Just 
look  at  all  she  has  done  for  Laura!  And  how  she  has  rewarded 
her!  The  slut!  .  .  ." 

"Armand!"  I  cried  indignantly.  "You  have  no  right  to  judge 
your  sister." 

But  he  continued  in  a  jerky,  hissing  voice: 

"On  the  contrary,  it's  because  I  am  no  better  than  she  that 
I  am  able  to  judge  her.  I  know  all  about  it.  Rachel  doesn't 
judge  us.  Rachel  never  judges  anyone.  .  .  .  Yes,  the  slut!  the 
slut!  ...  I  didn't  beat  about  the  bush  to  tell  her  what  I 
thought  of  her,  I  promise  you.  And  you !  To  have  covered  it  all 
up,  to  have  protected  it!  You  who  knew!  .  .  .  Grandfather  is 
as  blind  as  a  bat.  Mamma  tries  all  she  can  to  understand  noth- 
ing. As  for  Papa,  he  trusts  in  the  Lord;  it's  the  most  convenient 
thing  to  do.  Whenever  there's  a  difficulty,  he  falls  to  praying 
and  leaves  Rachel  to  get  out  of  it.  All  he  asks  is  to  remain  in 
the  dark.  He  rushes  about  like  a  lunatic;  he's  hardly  ever  at 
home.  I'm  not  surprised  he  finds  it  stifling  here.  As  for  me,  it's 
smothering  me  to  death.  He  tries  to  stupefy  himself,  by  Jove. 
In  the  mean  time  Mamma  writes  verses.  Oh!  I'm  not  blaming 
her;  I  write  them  myself.  But  at  any  rate,  I  know  I'm  nothing 
but  a  blackguard;  and  I've  never  pretended  to  be  anything 
else.  But,  I  say,  isn't  it  disgusting — Grandfather  setting  up  to 
do  the  charitable  by  La  Perouse,  because  he's  in  need  of  a  tutor? 
.  .  ."  Then,  suddenly:  "What's  that  beast  there  daring  to  say 
to  my  sister?  If  he  doesn't  take  his  hat  off  to  her  when  he  goes, 
I'll  black  his  bloody  eyes  for  him.  .  .  ." 

He  darted  towards  the  Bohemian,  and  I  thought  for  a  mo- 
ment he  was  going  to  hit  him.  But  at  Armand's  approach,  the 


227  AT  THE  VEDELS' 

man  made  a  theatrical  and  ironical  flourish  with  his  hat  and 
disappeared  under  the  archway.  At  that  moment  the  door  into 
the  street  opened  to  let  in  the  pastor.  He  was  dressed  in  a  frock 
coat,  chimney-pot  hat  and  black  gloves,  like  a  person  on  his 
way  back  from  a  christening  or  a  wedding.  The  ex-tutor  and  he 
exchanged  a  ceremonious  bow. 

Rachel  and  Armand  came  towards  me;  when  Vedel  joined 
them: 

"It's  all  arranged,"  said  Rachel  to  her  father. 

He  kissed  her  on  the  forehead. 

"Didn't  I  tell  you  so,  my  child?  God  never  abandons  those 
who  put  their  trust  in  Him." 

Then,  holding  out  his  hand  to  me: 

"Going  already?  .  .  .  Well,  we  shall  see  you  again  one  of 
these  days,  shan't  we?"

EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:   THIRD   VISIT  TO 
LA   PEROUSE 

Sept.  29th. — Visit  to  La  Perouse.  The  maid  hesitated  be- 
fore letting  me  in,  "Monsieur  won't  see  anyone."  I  insisted  so 
much  that  at  last  she  showed  me  into  the  drawing-room.  The 
shutters  were  shut;  in  the  semi-obscurity  1  could  hardly  make 
out  my  old  master,  as  he  sat  huddled  up  in  a  straight-backed 
arm-chair.  He  did  not  rise.  He  held  out  a  limp  hand,  without 
looking  at  me,  and  let  it  fall  again  as  soon  as  I  had  pressed  it. 
1  sat  down  beside  him,  so  that  I  could  see  him  only  in  profile. 
His  features  were  hard  and  unbending.  By  moments  his  lips 
moved,  but  he  said  nothing.  I  actually  doubted  whether  he 
recognized  me.  The  clock  struck  four;  then,  as  though  he  too 
were  moved  by  clock-work,  he  slowly  turned  his  head. 

"Why,"  he  asked,  and  his  voice  was  solemn  and  loud,  but  as 
toneless  as  though  it  came  from  beyond  the  grave,  "why  did 
they  let  you  in?  I  told  the  maid  to  say  if  anyone  came,  that 
Monsieur  de  La  Perouse  was  dead." 

I  was  greatly  distressed,  not  so  much  by  these  absurd  words, 
as  by  their  tone — a  declamatory  tone,  unspeakably  affected,  to 
which  I  was  unaccustomed  in  my  old  master — so  natural  with 
me,  as  a  rule — so  confiding. 

"The  girl  didn't  want  to  tell  a  falsehood,"  I  said  at  last. 
"Don't  scold  her  for  having  let  me  in.  I  am  happy  to  see  you." 

He  repeated  stolidly:  "Monsieur  de  La  Perouse  is  dead,"  and 
then  plunged  back  into  silence.  I  had  a  moment's  ill  temper 
and  got  up,  meaning  to  leave,  and  put  oflf  till  another  day 
the  task  of  finding  a  clue  to  this  melancholy  piece  of  acting. 
But  at  that  moment  the  maid  came  back;  she  was  carrying  a 
cup  of  smoking  chocolate: 


229  THIRD  VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

"Make  a  little  effort,  sir;  you  haven't  tasted  anything  all 
day." 

La  Perouse  made  an  impatient  gesture,  like  an  actor  whose 
effect  has  been  spoilt  by  a  clumsy  super. 

"Later.  When  the  gentleman  has  gone." 

But  the  maid  had  no  sooner  shut  the  door,  when: 

"Be  kind,  my  dear  friend.  Get  me  a  glass  of  water — plain 
water.  I'm  dying  of  thirst." 

I  found  a  water  bottle  and  a  glass  in  the  dining-room.  He 
filled  the  glass,  emptied  it  at  a  draught  and  wiped  his  lips  on 
the  sleeve  of  his  old  alpaca  coat. 

"Are  you  feverish?"  I  asked. 

The  words  brought  him  back  to  the  remembrance  of  the  part 
he  was  playing. 

"Monsieur  de  La  Perouse  is  not  feverish.  He  is  not  anything. 
On  Wednesday  evening  Monsieur  de  La  Perouse  ceased  to 
live."  I  wondered  whether  it  would  not  be  best  to  humour 
him. 

"Wasn't  Wednesday  the  very  day  little  Boris  came  to  see 
you  ?" 

He  turned  his  head  towards  me;  a  smile,  the  ghost  of  the  one 
he  used  to  have  at  Boris's  name,  lighted  up  his  features,  and  at 
last  consenting  to  abandon  his  role: 

"My  friend,"  he  said,  "I  can  at  any  rate  talk  to  you  about  it. 
That  Wednesday  was  the  last  day  I  had  left."  Then  he  went 
on  in  a  lower  voice:  "The  very  last  day,  in  fact,  which  I  had 
allowed  myself  before  .  .  .  putting  an  end  to  everything." 

It  was  with  extreme  pain  that  I  heard  La  Perouse  revert  to 
this  sinister  topic.  I  realized  that  I  had  never  taken  seriously 
what  he  had  said  about  it  before,  for  I  had  allowed  it  to  slip 
from  my  memory;  and  now  I  reproached  myself.  Now  I  re- 
membered everything  clearly,  but  I  was  astonished,  for  he  had 
at  first  mentioned  a  more  distant  date,  and  as  I  reminded  him 
of  this,  he  confessed,  in  a  voice  that  had  become  natural  again, 
and  even  a  little  ironical,  that  he  had  deceived  me  as  to  the 
date,  in  the  fear  that  I  should  try  and  prevent  him,  or  hasten 
my  return  from  abroad;  but  that  he  had  gone  on  his  knees 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  230 

several  nights  running  to  pray  God  to  allow  him  to  see  Boris 
before  dying. 

"And  I  had  even  agreed  with  Him,"  added  he,  "that  if  needs 
were,  1  should  delay  my  departure  for  a  few  days  .  .  .  because 
of  the  assurance  you  had  given  me  that  you  would  bring  him 
back  with  you,  do  you  remember?" 

I  had  taken  his  hand;  it  was  icy  and  1  chafed  it  between 
mine.  He  continued  in  a  monotonous  voice: 

"Then  when  1  saw  that  you  weren't  going  to  wait  till  the 
end  of  the  holidays  before  coming  back,  and  that  1  should  be 
able  to  see  the  boy  without  putting  off  my  departure,  I  thought 
...  it  seemed  to  me  that  God  had  heard  my  prayer.  I  thought 
that  He  approved  me.  Yes,  1  thought  that.  I  didn't  understand 
at  first  that  He  was  laughing  at  me,  as  usual." 

He  took  his  hand  from  between  mine  and  went  on  in  a  more 
animated  voice: 

"So  it  was  on  Wednesday  evening  that  I  had  resolved  to  put 
an  end  to  myself;  and  it  was  on  Wednesday  afternoon  that  you 
brought  me  Boris.  1  must  admit  that  I  did  not  feel  the  joy  I 
had  looked  forward  to  on  seeing  him.  I  thought  it  over 
afterwards.  Evidently  I  had  no  right  to  expect  that  the  child 
would  be  glad  to  see  me.  His  mother  has  never  talked  to  him 
about  me. 

He  stopped;  his  lips  trembled  and  I  thought  he  was  going 
to  cry. 

"Boris  asks  no  better  than  to  love  you,"  I  ventured,  "but 
give  him  time  to  know  you." 

"After  the  boy  had  left  me,"  went  on  La  Perouse,  without 
having  heard  me,  "when  I  found  myself  alone  again  in  the 
evening  (for  you  know  that  Madame  de  La  Perouse  is  no  longer 
here),  I  said  to  myself:  The  moment  has  come!  Now  for  it!' 
You  must  know  that  my  brother — the  one  I  lost — left  me  a 
pair  of  pistols,  which  1  always  keep  beside  me,  in  a  case,  by  my 
bedside.  I  went  then  to  fetch  the  case.  I  sat  down  in  an  arm- 
chair; there,  just  as  I  am  now.  I  loaded  one  of  the  pistols.  .  .  ." 

He  turned  towards  me  and  abruptly,  brutally,  repeated,  as  if 
I  had  doubted  his  word : 


231  THIRD  VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

"Yes,  I  did  load  it.  You  can  see  for  yourself.  It  still  is  loaded. 
What  happened?  I  can't  succeed  in  understanding.  I  put  the 
pistol  to  my  forehead.  1  held  it  for  a  long  time  against  my 
temple.  And  I  didn't  fire.  I  couldn't.  ...  At  the  last  moment — 
it's  shameful  ...  I  hadn't  the  courage  to  fire." 

He  had  grown  animated  while  speaking.  His  eye  was  livelier 
and  his  cheeks  faintly  flushed.  He  looked  at  me,  nodding  his 
head. 

"How  do  you  explain  that?  A  thing  1  had  resolved  on;  a 
thing  I  hadn't  ceased  thinking  of  for  months.  .  .  .  Perhaps 
that's  the  very  reason.  Perhaps  I  had  exhausted  all  my  courage 
in  thought  beforehand." 

"As  before  Boris's  arrival,  you  had  exhausted  the  joy  of  see- 
ing him,"  said  I;  but  he  continued: 

"I  stayed  a  long  time  with  the  pistol  to  my  temple.  My  finger 
was  on  the  trigger.  I  pressed  it  a  little;  but  not  hard  enough.  I 
said  to  myself:  'In  another  moment  I  shall  press  harder  and 
it  will  go  off.'  I  felt  the  cold  of  the  metal  and  I  said  to  myself: 
'In  another  moment  I  shall  not  feel  anything.  But  before  that 
I  shall  hear  a  terrible  noise.'  .  .  .  Just  think!  So  near  to  one's 
ear!  .  .  .  That's  the  chief  thing  that  prevented  me — the  fear 
of  the  noise.  .  .  .  It's  absurd,  for  as  soon  as  one's  dead  .  .  . 
Yes,  but  I  hope  for  death  as  a  sleep;  and  a  detonation  doesn't 
send  one  to  sleep — it  wakes  one  up.  .  .  .  Yes;  certainly  that 
was  what  I  was  afraid  of.  I  was  afraid  that  instead  of  going  to 
sleep  I  should  suddenly  wake  up." 

He  seemed  to  be  collecting  himself,  and  for  some  moments  his 
lips  again  moved  without  making  a  sound. 

"I  only  said  all  that  to  myself,"  he  went  on,  "afterwards.  In 
reality,  the  reason  I  didn't  kill  myself  is  that  I  wasn't  free.  I 
say  now  that  I  was  afraid;  but  no;  it  wasn't  that.  Something 
completely  foreign  to  my  will  held  me  back.  As  if  God  didn't 
want  to  let  me  go.  Imagine  a  marionette  who  should  want  to 
leave  the  stage  before  the  end  of  the  play.  .  .  .  Halt!  You're 
wanted  for  the  jinale.  Ah !  Ah !  you  thought  you  would  be  able 
to  go  off  whenever  you  liked!  ...  I  understood  that  what  we 
call  our  will  is  merely  the  threads  which  work  the  marionette. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  232 

and  which  God  pulls.  Don't  you  see?  Well,  I'll  explain.  For  in- 
stance, I  say  to  myself:  'Now  I'm  going  to  raise  my  right  arm'; 
and  I  raise  it."  (And  he  did  raise  it.)  "But  it's  because  the 
string  had  already  been  pulled  which  made  me  think  and  say: 
'I'm  going  to  raise  my  right  arm.'  .  .  .  And  the  proof  that  I'm 
not  free  is  that  if  it  had  been  my  left  arm  that  I  had  had  to 
raise,  I  should  have  said  to  you:  'Now  I'm  going  to  raise  my 
left  arm.'  ...  No;  I  see  you  don't  understand.  .  .  .  You  are 
not  free  to  understand.  ...  Oh!  I  realize  now  that  God  is 
playing  with  us.  It  amuses  him  to  let  us  think  that  what  he 
makes  us  do  is  what  we  wanted  to  do.  That's  his  horrible  game. 
...  Do  you  think  I'm  going  mad?  A  propos — Madame  de  La 
Perouse  .  .  .  you  know  she  has  gone  into  a  home?  .  .  .  Well, 
what  do  you  think?  She  is  convinced  that  it's  a  lunatic  asylum 
and  that  I  have  had  her  shut  up  to  get  rid  of  her — that  I  am 
passing  her  off  for  mad.  .  .  ,  You  must  grant  that  it's  rather  a 
curious  thing  that  the  first  passer-by  in  the  street  would  under- 
stand one  better  than  the  woman  one  has  given  one's  life  to. 
...  At  first  I  went  to  see  her  every  day.  But  as  soon  as  she 
caught  sight  of  me,  she  used  to  call  out:  'Ah!  there  you  are 
again!  come  to  spy  on  me!  .  .  .'  I  had  to  give  up  my  visits,  as 
they  only  irritated  her.  How  can  you  expect  one  to  care  about 
life,  when  one's  of  no  good  to  anyone?" 

His  voice  was  stifled  by  sobs.  He  dropped  his  head  and  I 
thought  he  was  going  to  relapse  again  into  his  dejection.  But 
with  a  sudden  start: 

"Do  you  know  what  she  did  before  she  left?  She  broke  open 
my  drawer  and  burnt  all  my  late  brother's  letters.  She  has 
always  been  jealous  of  my  brother;  especially  since  he  died.  She 
used  to  make  scenes  when  she  found  me  reading  his  letters  at 
night.  She  used  to  cry  out:  'Ah!  you  wanted  me  to  go  to  bed! 
You  do  things  on  the  sly!'  Or  else:  'You  had  far  better  go  to 
bed  and  sleep.  You're  tiring  your  eyes.'  One  would  have  said 
she  was  full  of  attentions;  but  I  know  her;  it  was  jealousy.  She 
didn't  want  to  leave  me  alone  with  him." 

"Because  she  loved  you.  There's  no  jealousy  without 
love." 


233  THIRD   VISIT  TO  LA   PEROUSE 

"Well,  you  must  allow  it's  a  melancholy  business  when  love, 
instead  of  making  the  happiness  of  life,  becomes  its  calamity. 
.  .  .  That's  no  doubt  the  way  God  loves  us." 

He  had  become  excited  while  he  was  speaking  and  all  of  a 
sudden  he  exclaimed: 

"I'm  hungry.  When  I  want  to  eat,  that  servant  always  brings 
me  chocolate.  I  suppose  Madame  de  La  Perouse  must  have  told 
her  that  I  never  took  anything  else.  It  would  be  very  kind  of 
you  to  go  to  the  kitchen  ...  the  second  door  on  the  right  in 
the  passage  .  .  .  and  see  whether  there  aren't  any  eggs.  I  think 
she  told  me  there  were  some  .  .  ." 

"Would  you  like  her  to  get  you  a  poached  egg?" 

"I  think  I  could  eat  two.  Will  you  be  so  kind?  I  can't  make 
myself  understood." 

"My  dear  friend,"  said  I  when  I  came  back,  "your  eggs  will 
be  ready  in  a  moment.  If  you'll  allow  me  I'll  stay  and  see  you 
eat  them;  yes;  it  will  be  a  pleasure.  I  was  very  much  dis- 
tressed just  now  to  hear  you  say  that  you  were  of  no  good  to 
anyone.  You  seem  to  forget  your  grandson.  Your  friend.  Mon- 
sieur Azai's,  proposes  that  you  should  go  and  live  with  him,  at 
the  school.  He  commissioned  me  to  tell  you  so.  He  thinks  that 
now  that  Madame  de  La  Perouse  is  no  longer  here,  there's  noth- 
ing to  keep  you." 

I  expected  some  resistance,  but  he  hardly  enquired  the  con- 
ditions of  the  new  existence  which  was  offered  him. 

"Though  I  didn't  kill  myself,  I  am  none  the  less  dead.  Here 
or  there,  it  doesn't  matter  to  me.  You  can  take  me  away." 

It  was  settled  I  should  come  and  fetch  him  the  next  day  but 
one;  and  that  before  then  I  should  put  at  his  disposal  two 
trunks,  for  him  to  pack  his  clothes  in  and  anything  else  he  might 
want  to  take  with  him. 

"And  besides,"  I  added,  "as  you  will  keep  this  apartment  on 
till  the  expiration  of  your  lease,  you  will  always  be  able  to  come 
and  fetch  anything  you  need." 

The  maid  brought  in  the  eggs,  which  he  devoured  hungrily.  I 
ordered  dinner  for  him,  greatly  relieved  to  see  that  nature  at 
last  was  getting  the  upper  hand. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  234 

"I  give  you  a  great  deal  of  trouble,"  he  kept  repeating.  "You 
are  very  kind." 

I  should  have  liked  him  to  hand  over  his  pistols  to  me,  and 
I  told  him  he  had  no  use  for  them  now;  but  he  would  not  con- 
sent to  part  with  them. 

"There's  nothing  to  fear.  What  I  didn't  do  that  day,  I  know 
I  shall  never  be  able  to  do.  But  they  are  the  only  remembrances 
I  have  left  of  my  brother — and  I  need  them  too  to  remind  me 
that  I  am  nothing  but  a  plaything  in  God's  hands." 


ly 

THE  FIRST  DAY  OF  THE  TERM 

The  day  was  very  hot.  Through  the  open  windows  of  the 
Vedels'  school  could  be  seen  the  tree-tops  of  the  Gardens,  over 
which  there  still  floated  an  immense,  unexhausted  store  of 
summer. 

The  first  day  of  the  term  was  an  opportunity  old  Azais  never 
missed  of  making  a  speech.  He  stood  at  the  foot  of  the  master's 
desk,  upright  and  facing  the  boys,  as  is  proper.  At  the  desk  sat 
old  La  Perouse.  He  had  risen  as  the  boys  came  in;  but  Azais, 
with  a  friendly  gesture,  signed  to  him  to  sit  down  again.  His 
anxious  eyes  had  gone  straight  to  Boris,  and  this  look  of  his 
embarrassed  Boris  all  the  more  because  Azais,  in  the  speech  in 
which  he  introduced  the  new  master  to  his  pupils,  thought  fit 
to  allude  to  his  relationship  to  one  of  them.  La  Perouse,  in  the 
mean  time  was  distressed  at  receiving  no  answering  look  from 
Boris — indifference,  he  thought,  coldness. 

"Oh!"  thought  Boris,  "if  only  he  would  leave  me  alone!  If 
only  he  wouldn't  make  me  'an  object'!"  His  schoolfellows  ter- 
rified him.  On  coming  out  of  the  lycee,  he  had  had  to  join  them, 
and  as  he  walked  with  them  from  the  lycee  to  the  Vedels',  he 
had  listened  to  their  talk.  He  would  have  liked  to  fall  in  with 
it,  for  he  had  great  need  of  sympathy,  but  he  was  of  too 
fastidious  and  sensitive  a  nature,  and  he  could  not  overcome  his 
repugnance;  the  words  froze  on  his  lips;  he  reproached  himself 
for  his  foolishness  and  tried  hard  not  to  let  it  show;  tried  hard 
even  to  laugh,  so  as  not  to  be  scoff'ed  at;  but  it  was  no  good;  he 
looked  like  a  girl  among  the  others,  and  realized  it  sorrowfully. 

They  had  broken  up  into  groups  almost  immediately.  A  cer- 
tain Leon  Gheridanisol  was  a  central  figure  and  was  already  be- 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  236 

ginning  to  take  the  lead.  Rather  older  than  the  others,  and  more 
advanced  in  his  studies,  of  a  dark  complexion,  with  black  hair 
and  black  eyes,  Gheridanisol  was  neither  very  tall  nor  partic- 
ularly strong — but  he  had  what  is  called  "lip."  Really  infernal 
lip!  Even  young  George  Molinier  admitted  that  Gheridanisol 
had  "made  him  sit  up";  "and  you  know,  it  takes  a  good  deal 
to  make  me  sit  up!"  Hadn't  he  seen  him  that  very  morning, 
with  his  own  eyes,  go  up  to  a  young  woman  who  was  carrying  a 
child  in  her  arms: 

"Is  that  kid  yours,  Madam?"  (This  with  a  low  bow.)  "It's 
jolly  ugly,  I  must  say.  But  don't  worry.  It  won't  live." 

George  was  still  rocking. 

"No?  Honour  bright?"  said  Philippe  Adamanti,  his  friend, 
when  George  told  him  the  story. 

This  piece  of  insolence  filled  them  with  rapture;  impossible 
to  imagine  anything  funnier.  A  stale  enough  joke.  Leon  had 
learnt  it  from  his  cousin  Strouvilhou,  but  that  was  no  business 
of  George's. 

At  school,  Molinier  and  Adamanti  got  leave  to  sit  on  the 
same  bench  as  Gheridanisol — the  fifth,  so  as  not  to  be  too  near 
the  usher.  Molinier  had  Adamanti  on  his  left  hand  and  Ghe- 
ridanisol (Gheri  for  short)  on  his  right;  at  the  end  of  the  bench 
sat  Boris.  Behind  him  was  Passavant. 

Gontran  de  Passavant's  life  has  been  a  sad  one  since  his 
father's  death — not  that  it  had  been  very  lively  before  it.  He 
had  long  ago  understood  that  he  could  expect  no  sympathy  from 
his  brother,  no  support.  He  had  spent  his  holidays  in  Brittany, 
where  his  old  nurse,  the  faithful  Seraphine,  had  taken  him  to 
stay  with  her  people.  All  his  qualities  are  folded  inwards;  he 
devotes  himself  to  his  work.  A  secret  desire  spurs  him  on  to 
prove  to  his  brother  that  he  is  worth  more  than  he.  It  is  by 
his  own  choice  that  he  is  at  school ;  out  of  a  wish  too  not  to  go 
on  living  with  his  brother  in  the  big  house  in  the  Rue  de  Baby- 
lone,  which  has  nothing  but  melancholy  recollections  for  him. 
Seraphine  has  taken  a  lodging  in  Paris  so  as  not  to  leave  him 
alone;  she  is  able  to  do  this  with  the  little  pension  specially  left 
her  by  the  late  Count's  will  and  served  her  by  his  two  sons.  Gon- 


237  FIRST  DAY  OF  THE  TERM 

tran  has  one  of  her  rooms,  and  it  is  here  that  he  spends  his  free 
time.  He  has  furnished  it  to  his  own  taste.  He  takes  two  meals 
a  week  with  Seraphine;  she  looks  after  him  and  sees  that  he 
wants  for  nothing.  When  he  is  with  her,  Gontran  chatters  freely 
enough,  though  he  can  speak  to  her  of  hardly  any  of  the  things 
he  has  most  at  heart.  At  school  he  keeps  his  independence;  he 
listens  absent-mindedly  to  his  schoolfellows'  nonsense,  and  often 
refuses  to  join  in  their  games.  He  prefers  reading  to  any  but 
out-of-door  games.  He  likes  sports — all  kinds  of  sports — but 
preferably  those  that  are  solitary.  For  he  is  proud  and  will  not 
associate  with  everyone.  On  Sundays,  according  to  the  season, 
he  skates  or  swims,  or  boats,  or  takes  immense  walks  in  the 
country.  He  has  repugnances  and  does  not  try  to  overcome 
them;  nor  does  he  try  to  widen  his  mind  so  much  as  to 
strengthen  it.  He  is  perhaps  not  so  simple  as  he  thinks— as  he 
tries  to  make  himself  become;  we  have  seen  him  at  his  father's 
death-bed;  but  he  does  not  like  mysteries  and  whenever  he  is 
unlike  himself,  he  is  disgusted.  If  he  succeeds  in  remaining  at 
the  top  of  his  class,  it  is  through  application,  not  through 
facility.  Boris  would  find  a  protector  in  him,  if  he  were  only 
to  look  towards  him,  but  it  is  his  neighbour  George  who  at- 
tracts him.  As  for  George,  he  has  eyes  for  no  one  but  Gheri, 
who  has  eyes  for  no  one. 

George  had  some  important  news  to  communicate  to  Philippe 
Adamanti,  which  he  had  judged  it  more  prudent  not  to  write. 

That  morning  he  had  arrived  at  the  lycee  doors  a  quarter 
of  an  hour  before  the  opening  and  had  waited  for  him  in  vain. 
It  was  while  he  was  waiting  that  he  had  heard  Leon  Gheri- 
danisol  apostrophize  the  young  woman  so  brilliantly,  after 
which  incident  the  two  urchins  had  entered  into  conversation 
and  had  discovered  to  George's  great  joy  that  they  were  going 
to  be  schoolfellows. 

On  coming  out  of  the  lycee,  George  and  Phiphi  had  at  last 
succeeded  in  meeting.  They  walked  to  the  Pension  Aza'is  in 
company  with  the  other  boys,  but  a  little  apart,  so  as  to  be 
able  to  talk  freely. 

"You  had  better  hide  that  thing,"  George  had  begun,  point- 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  238 

ing  to  the  yellow  rosette  which  Phiphi  was  still  sporting  in  his 
buttonhole. 

"Why?"  asked  Philippe,  noticing  that  George  was  no  longer 
wearing  his. 

"You  run  the  risk  of  getting  collared.  1  wanted  to  tell  you  be- 
fore school,  my  boy;  why  didn't  you  turn  up  earlier?  I  was 
waiting  outside  the  doors  to  warn  you." 

"But  I  didn't  know,"  Phiphi  had  answered. 

"I  didn't  know.  1  didn't  know,"  George  repeated,  mimicking 
him.  "You  might  have  guessed  that  there  would  be  things  to 
tell  you  when  1  didn't  see  you  again  at  Houlgate." 

The  perpetual  aim  and  object  of  these  two  boys  is  to  get 
the  better  of  each  other.  His  father's  situation  and  fortune  give 
Philippe  certain  advantages,  but  George  is  greatly  superior  in 
audacity  and  cynicism.  Phiphi  has  to  make  an  effort  to  keep 
up  with  him.  He  isn't  a  bad  boy;  but  lacking  in  back  bone. 

"Well  then,  out  with  your  things!"  he  had  said. 

Leon  Gheridanisol,  who  had  come  up,  was  listening  to  them. 
George  was  not  ill  pleased  that  he  should  overhear  him;  if 
Gheri  had  filled  him  with  admiration  just  now,  George  had  a 
little  surprise  in  store  for  Gheri;  he  therefore  answered  Phiphi 
quite  calmly: 

"That  girl  Praline  has  got  run  in." 

"Praline!"  cried  Phiphi,  thunderstruck  by  George's  cool- 
ness. And  Leon  showed  signs  of  being  interested.  Phiphi  said  to 
George : 

"Can  one  tell  him?" 

"As  you  please,"  said  George,  shrugging  his  shoulders.  Then 
Phiphi,  pointing  to  George: 

"She's  his  tart."  Then  to  George: 

"How  do  you  know?" 

"1   met  Germaine  and  she  told  me." 

And  he  went  on  to  tell  Phiphi  how,  when  he  had  come  up  to 
Paris  a  fortnight  before,  he  had  wanted  to  visit  the  apartment 
which  the  procureur  Molinier  had  once  called  "the  scene  of  the 
orgies,"  and  had  found  the  doors  closed;  that  a  little  later  as  he 
was  strolling  about  the  neighbourhood,  he  had  met  Germaine 


239  FIRST  DAY  OF  THE  TERM 

(Phiphi's  tart)  and  she  had  given  him  the  news:  the  place  had 
been  raided  by  the  police  at  the  beginning  of  the  holidays.  What 
neither  the  women  nor  the  boys  knew,  was  that  Profitendieu 
had  taken  good  care  to  wait  before  taking  this  action  until  the 
younger  delinquents  should  have  left  Paris,  so  that  their  par- 
ents might  be  spared  the  scandal  of  their  being  caught. 

"Oh,  Lord!  .  .  ."  repeated  Phiphi  without  comments.  "Oh 
Lord!  .  .  ."  It  had  been  a  narrow  squeak,  thought  he,  for 
George  and  him. 

"Makes  your  marrow  freeze,  eh?"  said  George,  with  a  grin. 
He  considered  it  perfectly  useless  to  confess — especially  before 
Gheridanisol,  that  he  had  himself  been  terrified. 

From  the  dialogue  here  recorded,  these  children  might  be 
thought  more  depraved  than  they  actually  are.  I  feel  convinced 
that  it  is  chiefly  to  show  off  that  they  talk  in  this  way.  There 
is  a  good  deal  of  bravado  in  their  case.  No  matter:  Gheridanisol 
is  listening  to  them.  He  listens  and  leads  them  on.  His  cousin 
Strouvilhou  will  be  greatly  amused  when  he  reports  the  con- 
versation to  him  this  evening. 

That  same  evening  Bernard  went  to  see  Edouard. 

"Well?  Did  the  first  day  go  off  all  right?" 

"Pretty  well."  And  then  as  he  said  no  more: 

"Master  Bernard,  if  you  are  not  in  the  humour  to  talk  of 
your  own  accord,  don't  expect  me  to  pump  you.  There's  noth- 
ing I  dislike  so  much.  But  allow  me  to  remind  you  that  you 
offered  me  your  services  and  that  I  have  a  right  to  expect  a  few 
stories.  .  .  ." 

"What  do  you  want  to  know?"  rejoined  Bernard,  with  no 
very  good  grace.  "That  old  Azais  made  a  solemn  speech  and 
exhorted  the  boys  'to  press  forward  in  a  common  endeavour  and 
with  the  impetuous  ardour  of  youth  .  .  .'?  I  remember  those 
words  because  they  occurred  three  times.  Armand  declares  the 
old  boy  regularly  puts  them  into  all  his  pi-jaws.  He  and  I 
were  sitting  on  the  last  bench  at  the  back  of  the  class-room, 
watching  the  boys  come  into  school — like  Noah,  watching  the 
animals  come  into  the  Ark.  There  were  every  kind  and  sort — 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  240 

ruminants,  pachiderms,  molluscs  and  other  invertebrates.  When 
they  began  to  talk  to  each  other  after  the  speech,  Armand  and 
I  calculated  that  four  sentences  out  of  ten  began  with:  'I  bet 
you  won't.  ,  .  .' " 

"And  the  other  six?" 

"  'As  for  me,  /...'" 

"Not  badly  observed,  I'm  afraid.  What  else?" 

"Some  of  them  seem  to  me  to  have  a  fabricated  personality." 

"What  do  you  mean  by  that?"  asked  Edouard. 

"I  am  thinking  particularly  of  a  boy  who  sat  beside  young 
Passavant.  (Passavant  himself  just  seems  to  me  a  good  boy.) 
His  neighbour,  whom  I  watched  for  a  long  time,  appears  to  have 
adopted  the  'Ne  quid  nimis  of  the  ancients  as  his  rule  of  life. 
Doesn't  that  strike  you  as  an  absurd  device  at  his  age?  His 
clothes  are  meagre;  his  neck-tie  exiguous;  even  his  bootlaces 
are  only  just  long  enough  to  tie.  In  the  course  of  a  few  moments, 
energies,  and  to  repeat,  like  a  refrain:  'Let's  have  no  useless 
efforts!'" 

"A  plague  upon  the  economical!"  said  Edouard.  "In  art  they 
turn  into  the  prolix." 

"Why?" 

"Because  they  can't  bear  to  lose  anything.  What  else?  You 
have  said  nothing  about  Armand." 

"He's  an  odd  chap.  To  tell  you  the  truth,  I  don't  much  care 
for  him.  I  don't  like  contortionists.  He's  by  no  means  stupid; 
but  he  uses  his  intelligence  for  mere  destruction;  for  that  matter, 
it's  against  himself  that  he's  the  most  ferocious;  everything 
that's  good  in  him,  that's  generous,  or  noble,  or  tender,  he's 
ashamed  of.  He  ought  to  go  in  for  sport — take  the  air.  Being 
shut  up  indoors  all  day  is  turning  him  sour.  He  seems  to  like 
my  company.  I  don't  avoid  him;  but  I  can't  get  accustomed  to 
his  cast  of  mind." 

"Don't  you  think  that  his  sarcasm  and  his  irony  are  the  veil 
of  excessive  sensitiveness — and  perhaps  of  great  suffering? 
Olivier  thinks  so." 

"It  may  be.  I  have  sometimes  wondered.  I  don't  know  him 


241  FIRST  DAY  OF  THE  TERM 

well  enough  to  say  yet.  The  rest  of  my  reflections  are  not  ripe.  I 
must  think  them  over.  I'll  tell  you  about  them — but  later.  This 
evening,  forgive  me  if  I  leave  you.  I've  got  my  examination  in 
two  days;  and  besides,  I  may  as  well  own  up  to  it  ...  I'm 
feeling  sad."

Fenelon. 

Olivier,  vho  had  returned  to  Paris  the  day  before,  arose  that 
morning  fresh  and  rested.  The  air  was  warm,  the  sky  pure. 
When  he  went  out,  after  his  shave  and  his  shower-bath,  ele- 
gantly dressed,  conscious  of  his  strength,  his  youth,  his  beauty, 
Passavant  was  still  sleeping. 

Olivier  hastened  to  the  Sorbonne.  This  was  the  morning  that 
Bernard  had  to  go  up  for  his  examination.  How  did  Olivier 
know  that?  But  perhaps  he  didn't  know  it.  He  was  going  to  find 
out. 

He  quickened  his  step.  He  had  not  seen  his  friend  since  the 
night  that  Bernard  came  to  take  refuge  in  his  room.  What 
changes  since  then!  Who  knows  whether  he  was  not  more 
anxious  to  show  himself  to  his  friend  than  to  see  him.  A  pity 
that  Bernard  cared  so  little  about  elegance.  But  it's  a  taste  that 
sometimes  comes  with  affluence.  Olivier  knew  that  by  experience, 
thanks  to  the  Comte  de  Passavant. 

Bernard  was  doing  his  written  examination  this  morning.  He 
wouldn't  be  out  before  twelve.  Olivier  waited  for  him  in  the 
quadrangle.  He  recognized  a  few  of  his  school-fellows,  shook  a 
few  hands.  He  felt  slightly  embarrassed  by  his  clothes.  He  felt 
still  more  so  when  Bernard,  free  at  last,  came  up  to  him  in  the 
quadrangle  and  exclaimed,  with  outstretched  hand: 

"Oh,  dear!  how  lovely  he  is''' 

Olivier,  who  had  thought  he  would  never  blush  again, 
blushed.  He  could  not  but  feel  the  irony  of  these  words,  not- 


243  OLIVIER  MEETS   BERNARD 

withstanding  the  cordiality  of  their  tone.  As  for  Bernard,  he 
was  still  wearing  the  same  suit  he  had  on  the  evening  of  his 
flight.  He  had  not  been  expecting  to  see  Olivier.  With  his  arm 
in  his,  he  drew  him  along,  questioning  as  they  v^'ent.  He  felt  a 
sudden  shock  of  joy  at  seeing  him.  If  at  first  he  smiled  a  little 
at  the  refinement  of  his  dress,  it  was  with  no  malice;  his  heart 
was  good;  he  was  without  bitterness. 

"You'll  lunch  with  me,  won't  you?  Yes;  I  have  got  to  go 
back  at  one  thirty  for  Latin.  This  morning  it  was  French." 

"Pleased?" 

"/  am,  yes;  but  I  don't  know  whether  the  examiners  will  be. 
We  had  to  discuss  these  lines  from  La  Fontaine : 

'Papillon  du  Parnasse,  et  semblable  aux  abeilles 
A  qui  le  bon  Platon  compare  nos  merveilles. 
Je  suis  chose  legere  et  vole  a  tout  sujet, 
Je  vats  de  fleur  en  fieur  et  d'objet  en  objet.' 

How  would  you  have  done  it?" 

Olivier  could  not  resist  a  desire  to  shine: 

"I  should  have  said  that  La  Fontaine,  in  painting  himself, 
had  painted  the  portrait  of  the  artist — of  the  man  who  con- 
sents to  take  merely  the  outside  of  things,  their  surface,  their 
bloom.  Then  I  should  have  contrasted  with  that  the  portrait 
of  the  scholar,  the  seeker,  the  man  who  goes  deep  into  things, 
and  I  should  have  shown  that  while  the  scholar  seeks,  the 
artist  finds;  that  the  man  who  goes  deep,  gets  stuck,  the  man 
who  gets  stuck,  gets  sunk — up  to  his  eyes  and  over  them;  that 
the  truth  is  the  appearance  of  things,  that  their  secret  is  their 
form  and  that  what  is  deepest  in  man  is  his  skin." 

This  last  phrase  Olivier  had  stolen  from  Passavant,  who 
himself  had  gathered  it  from  the  lips  of  Paul-Ambroise,  as  he 
was  discoursing  one  day  in  a  lady's  drawing-room.  Everything 
that  was  not  printed  was  fish  for  Passavant's  net;  what  he  called 
"ideas  in  the  air" — that  is  to  say — other  people's. 

Something  or  other  in  Olivier's  tone  showed  Bernard  that 
this  phrase  was  not  his  own.  Olivier's  voice  did  not  seem  at 
home  in  it.  Bernard  was  on  the  point  of  asking:  "Whose?" 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  244 

But  besides  not  wishing  to  hurt  his  friend,  he  was  afraid  of 
hearing  Passavant's  name,  which  up  till  now  had  not  been 
pronounced.  Bernard  contented  himself  with  giving  his 
friend  a  searching  look;  and  Olivier,  for  the  second  time, 
blushed. 

Bernard's  surprise  at  hearing  the  sentimental  Olivier  give 
voice  to  ideas  which  were  entirely  different  from  those  which 
he  had  once  known  him  to  have,  immediately  gave  place  to 
violent  indignation;  he  was  overwhelmed  by  something  as  sud- 
den and  surprising  and  irresistible  as  a  cyclone.  And  it  was  not 
precisely  against  the  ideas  themselves  that  he  was  angry — 
though  they  struck  him  as  absurd.  And  even  perhaps,  after  all, 
they  were  not  as  absurd  as  all  that.  In  his  collection  of  con- 
tradictory opinions,  he  might  have  written  them  down  on  the 
page  facing  his  own.  Had  they  been  genuinely  Olivier's  ideas, 
he  would  not  have  been  angry  either  with  him  or  with  them; 
but  he  felt  there  was  someone  hidden  behind  them;  it  was  with 
Passavant  that  he  was  angry. 

"It's  with  ideas  like  those  that  France  is  being  poisoned!"  he 
cried  in  a  muffled,  vehement  voice.  He  took  a  high  stand.  He 
wished  to  outsoar  Passavant.  And  he  was  himself  surprised  at 
what  he  said — as  if  his  words  had  preceded  his  thoughts;  and 
yet  it  was  these  very  thoughts  he  had  developed  that  morning 
in  his  essay;  but  he  felt  shamefaced  at  expressing  what  he 
called  'Tme  sentiments,"  particularly  when  he  was  talking  to 
Olivier.  As  soon  as  they  were  put  into  words,  they  seemed  to 
him  less  sincere.  So  that  Olivier  had  never  heard  his  friend 
speak  of  the  interests  of  "France";  it  was  his  turn  to  be  sur- 
prised. He  opened  his  eyes  wide,  without  even  thinking  of  smil- 
ing. Was  it  really  Bernard?  He  repeated  stupidly: 

"France?  .  .  ."  Then,  so  as  to  disengage  his  responsibility — 
for  Bernard  was  decidedly  not  joking: 

"But,  old  boy,  it  isn't  /  who  think  so,  it's  La  Fontaine." 

Bernard  became  almost  aggressive: 

"By  Jove,  I  know  well  enough  it  isn't  you  who  think  so.  But, 
my  dear  fellow,  it  isn't  La  Fontaine  either.  If  he  had  only  had 
that  lightness,  which,  for  that  matter,  he  regretted  and  apol- 


245  OLIVIER   MEETS   BERNARD 

ogized  for  at  the  end  of  his  life,  he  would  never  have  been  the 
artist  we  admire.  That's  just  what  1  said  in  my  essay  this  morn- 
ing, and  I  brought  a  great  many  quotations  in  support  of  my 
theory — for  you  know  I've  a  fairly  good  memory.  But  I  soon 
left  La  Fontaine,  and  taking  as  my  text  the  justification  these 
lines  might  afford  to  a  certain  class  of  superficial  minds,  1  just 
let  myself  go  in  a  tirade  against  the  spirit  of  carelessness,  of 
flippancy,  of  irony,  of  what  is  called  Trench  wit,'  which  some 
people  think  is  the  spirit  of  France,  and  which  sometimes  gives 
us  such  a  deplorable  reputation  among  foreigners.  I  said  that 
we  ought  not  to  consider  all  this  as  even  the  smile  of  France, 
but  as  her  grimace;  that  the  real  spirit  of  France  was  a  spirit 
of  investigation,  of  logic,  of  devotedness,  of  patient  thorough- 
ness; and  if  La  Fontaine  had  not  been  animated  by  that  spirit, 
he  might  have  written  his  tales,  but  never  his  fables  nor  the 
admirable  epistle  (I  showed  that  I  knew  it)  from  which  the 
lines  we  had  to  comment  upon  were  taken.  Yes,  old  boy,  a  vio- 
lent attack — perhaps  I  shall  get  ploughed  for  it.  But  I  don't  care 
two  straws;  I  had  to  say  it." 

Olivier  had  not  particularly  meant  what  he  had  said  just  be- 
fore. He  had  yielded  to  his  desire  to  be  brilliant  and  to  bring 
out,  as  it  were  carelessly,  a  sentence  which  he  thought  would 
tremendously  impress  his  friend.  But  now  that  Bernard  took 
it  in  this  way,  there  was  nothing  for  him  to  do  but  to  beat  a  re- 
treat. But  his  great  weakness  lay  in  the  fact  that  he  was  in  much 
more  need  of  Bernard's  affection  than  Bernard  of  his.  Bernard's 
speech  had  humiliated,  mortified  him.  He  was  vexed  with  him- 
self for  having  spoken  too  soon.  It  was  too  late  now  to  go  back 
on  it — to  agree  with  Bernard,  as  he  certainly  would  have  done 
if  he  had  let  him  speak  first.  But  how  could  he  have  foreseen 
that  Bernard,  whom  he  remembered  so  scathingly  subversive, 
would  set  up  as  a  defender  of  feelings  and  ideas  which  Pas- 
savant  had  taught  him  could  not  be  considered  without  a  smile? 
But  he  really  had  no  desire  to  smile  now;  he  was  ashamed.  And 
as  he  could  neither  retract  nor  contradict  Bernard,  whose 
genuine  emotion  he  couldn't  help  respecting,  his  one  idea  was  to 
protect  himself — to  slip  out  of  it. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  246 

"Oh!  well,  if  you  put  that  in  your  essay,  it  wasn't  against  me 
that  you  were  saying  it.  ...  I'm  glad  of  that." 

He  spoke  as  though  he  were  vexed — not  at  all  in  the  tone  he 
would  have  liked. 

"But  it  is  against  you  that  I  am  saying  it  now,"  retorted 
Bernard. 

These  words  cut  straight  at  Olivier's  heart.  Bernard  had 
certainly  not  said  them  with  a  hostile  intention,  but  how  else 
could  they  be  taken?  Olivier  was  silent.  Between  Bernard  and 
him  a  gulf  was  yawning.  He  tried  to  think  of  some  question  to 
fling  from  one  side  of  the  gulf  to  the  other  which  might  re- 
establish the  contact.  He  tried,  without  much  hope  of  succeed- 
ing. "Doesn't  he  understand  how  miserable  1  am?"  he  said  to 
himself,  and  he  grew  more  miserable  still.  He  did  not  have  to 
force  back  his  tears,  perhaps,  but  he  said  to  himself  that  it  was 
enough  to  make  anyone  cry.  It  was  his  own  fault,  too;  his  meet- 
ing with  Bernard  would  have  seemed  less  sad  if  he  had  looked 
forward  to  it  with  less  joy.  When  two  months  before  he  had 
hurried  off  to  meet  Edouard,  it  had  been  the  same  thing.  It 
would  always  be  the  same  thing,  he  said  to  himself.  He  wanted 
to  go  away — anywhere — by  himself — to  chuck  Bernard — to  for- 
get Passavant,  Edouard.  ...  An  unexpected  meeting  suddenly 
interrupted  these  melancholy  thoughts. 

A  few  steps  in  front  of  them,  going  up  the  Boulevard  Saint- 
Michel,  along  which  he  and  Bernard  were  walking,  Olivier 
caught  sight  of  his  young  brother  George.  He  seized  Bernard's 
arm,  and,  turning  sharply  on  his  heel,  drew  him  hurriedly  along 
with  him. 

"Do  you  think  he  saw  us?  .  ,  .  My  people  don't  know  I'm 
back." 

Young  George  was  not  alone.  Leon  Gheridanisol  and  Philippe 
Adamanti  were  with  him.  The  conversation  of  the  three  boys 
was  exceedingly  animated;  but  George's  interest  in  it  did  not 
prevent  him  from  keeping  "his  eyes  skinned,"  as  he  said.  In 
order  to  listen  to  the  children's  talk  we  will  leave  Olivier  and 
Bernard  for  a  moment;  especially  since  our  two  friends  have 


247  OLIVIER   MEETS   BERNARD 

gone  into  a  restaurant,  and  are  for  the  moment  more  occupied 
in  eating  than  in  talking — to  Olivier's  great  relief. 

"Well  then,  you  do  it,"  says  Phiphi  to  George. 

"Oh,  he's  got  the  dithers!  He's  got  the  dithers!"  retorts 
George,  putting  what  cold  contempt  he  can  into  his  voice,  so  as 
to  goad  Philippe  to  action.  Then  says  Gheridanisol  with  calm 
superiority: 

"Look  here,  my  lambs,  if  you  aren't  game,  you  had  better 
say  so  at  once.  I  shan't  have  any  difficulty  in  finding  fellows 
with  a  little  more  pluck  than  you.  Here!  Give  it  back!" 

He  turns  to  George,  who  is  holding  a  small  coin  in  his  tight- 
shut  hand. 

"I'll  do  it!"  cries  George,  in  a  sudden  burst  of  courage. 
"Won't  I  just!  Come  on!"  (They  are  opposite  a  tobacco  shop.) 

"No,"  says  Leon;  "we'll  wait  for  you  at  the  corner.  Come 
along,  Phiphi." 

A  moment  later  George  comes  out  of  the  shop;  he  has  a 
packet  of  so-called  "de  luxe"  cigarettes  in  his  hand  and  offers 
them  to  his  friends. 

"Well?"  asks  Phiphi  anxiously. 

"Well,  what?"  replies  George  with  an  air  of  affected  indif- 
ference, as  if  what  he  has  just  done  has  suddenly  become  so 
natural  that  it  wasn't  worth  mentioning. 

But  Philippe  insists: 

"Did  you  pass  it?" 

"Good  Lord!  Didn't  I?" 

"And  nobody  said  anything?" 

George  shrugged  his  shoulders: 

"What  on  earth  should  they  say?" 

"And  they  gave  you  back  the  change?" 

This  time  George  doesn't  even  deign  to  answer.  But  as 
Philippe,  still  a  little  sceptical  and  fearful,  insists  again:  "Show 
us,"  George  pulls  the  money  out  of  his  pocket.  Philippe  counts — 
the  seven  francs  are  there  right  enough.  He  feels  inclined  to 
ask:  "Are  you  sure  they  aren't  false  too?"  But  he  refrains. 

George  had  given  one  franc  for  the  false  coin.  It  had  been 
agreed  that  the  money  should  be  divided  between  them.  He 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  248 

holds  out  three  francs  to  Gheridanisol.  As  for  Phiphi,  he  shan't 
have  a  farthing;  at  the  outside  a  cigarette;  it'll  be  a  lesson  to 
him. 

Encouraged  by  this  first  success,  Phiphi  is  now  anxious  to 
try  for  himself.  He  asks  Leon  to  sell  him  another  coin.  But 
Leon  considers  Phiphi  a  muff,  and  in  order  to  screw  him  up  to 
the  right  pitch,  he  affects  contempt  for  his  former  cowardice 
and  pretends  to  hold  back.  He  had  only  to  make  up  his  mind 
sooner;  they  could  very  well  do  without  him.  Besides  which, 
Leon  thinks  it  imprudent  to  risk  another  attempt  so  close  upon 
the  first.  And  then  it's  too  late  now.  His  cousin  Strouvilhou  is 
expecting  him  to  lunch. 

Gheridanisol  is  not  such  a  duffer  that  he  can't  pass  his  false 
coins  by  himself;  but  his  big  cousin's  instructions  are  that  he 
is  to  get  himself  accomplices.  He  goes  off  now  to  give  him  an 
account  of  his  successfully  performed  mission, 

"The  kids  we  want,  you  see,  are  those  who  come  of  good 
families,  because  then  if  rumours  get  about,  their  parents  do 
all  they  can  to  stifle  them."  (It  is  Cousin  Strouvilhou  who  is 
talking  in  this  way,  while  the  two  are  having  lunch  together.) 
"Only  with  this  system  of  selling  the  coins  one  by  one,  they 
get  put  into  circulation  too  slowly.  I've  got  fifty-two  boxes  con- 
taining twenty  coins  each,  to  dispose  of.  They  must  be  sold  for 
twenty  francs  a  box;  but  not  to  anyone,  you  understand.  The 
best  thing  would  be  to  form  an  association  to  which  no  one 
should  be  admitted  who  didn't  furnish  pledges.  The  kids  must 
be  made  to  compromise  themselves,  and  hand  over  something 
or  other  which  vyill  give  us  a  hold  over  their  parents.  Before 
letting  them  have  the  coins,  they  must  be  made  to  understand 
that — oh!  without  frightening  them.  One  must  never  frighten 
children.  You  told  me  Molinier's  father  was  a  magistrate?  Good. 
And  Adamanti's  father?" 

"A  senator." 

"Better  still.  You're  old  enough  now  to  grasp  that  there's  no 
family  without  some  skeleton  or  other  in  the  cupboard,  which 
the  people  concerned  are  terrified  of  having  discovered.  The 


249  OLIVIER  MEETS   BERNARD 

kids  must  be  set  hunting;  it'll  give  them  something  to  do. 
Family  life  as  a  rule  is  so  boring!  And  then  it'll  teach  them  to 
observe,  to  look  about  them.  It's  quite  simple.  Those  who  con- 
tribute nothing  will  get  nothing.  When  certain  parents  under- 
stand that  they  are  in  our  hands,  they'll  pay  a  high  price  for 
our  silence.  What  the  deuce!  we  have  no  intention  of  black- 
mailing them;  we  are  honest  folk.  We  merely  want  to  have  a 
hold  on  them.  Their  silence  for  ours.  Let  them  keep  silent  and 
make  other  people  keep  silent,  and  then  we'll  keep  silent  too. 
Here's  a  health  to  them!" 

Strouvilhou  filled  two  glasses.  They  drank  to  each  other. 

"It's  a  good — it's  even  an  indispensable  thing,"  he  went  on, 
"to  create  ties  of  reciprocity  between  citizens;  by  so  doing 
societies  are  solidly  established.  We  all  hold  together,  good 
Lord!  We  have  a  hold  on  the  children,  who  have  a  hold  on 
their  parents,  who  have  a  hold  on  us.  A  perfect  arrangement. 
Twig?" 

Leon  twigged  admirably.  He  chuckled. 

"That  little  George  .  .  ."  he  began. 

"Well,  what  about  him?  That  little  George  .  .  .?" 

"Molinier.  I  think  he's  pretty  well  screwed  up.  He  has  laid  his 
hands  on  some  letters  to  his  father  from  an  Olympia  chorus 
girl." 

"Have  you  seen  them?" 

"He  showed  them  to  me.  I  overheard  him  talking  to 
Adamanti.  I  think  they  were  pleased  at  my  listening  to  them; 
at  any  rate  they  didn't  hide  from  me;  I  had  already  taken  steps 
and  treated  them  to  a  little  entertainment  in  your  style,  to  in- 
spire them  with  confidence.  George  said  to  Phiphi  (to  give  him 
a  stunner) :  'My  father's  got  a  mistress.'  Upon  which,  Phiphi, 
not  to  be  outdone,  answered:  'My  father's  got  two.'  It  was 
idiotic  and  really  nothing  to  make  a  fuss  about;  but  I  went 
up  to  George  and  said:  'How  do  you  know?'  'I've  seen  some 
letters,"  he  answered.  I  pretended  1  didn't  believe  him  and  said: 
'Rubbish!'  ,  .  .  Well,  I  went  on  at  him,  until  at  last  he  said  he 
had  got  them  with  him;  he  pulled  them  out  of  a  big  letter- 
case  and  showed  them  to  me." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  250 

"Did  you  read  them?" 

"I  didn't  have  time  to,  I  only  saw  they  were  all  in  the  same 
handwriting;  one  of  them  began:  'My  darling  old  ducky.'  " 

"And  signed?" 

"  'Your  little  white  mousie.'  I  asked  George  how  he  had  got 
hold  of  them.  He  grinned  and  pulled  out  of  his  trouser  pocket 
an  enormous  bunch  of  keys.  .  .  .  'To  fit  every  drawer  in  the 
universe/  said  he." 

"And  what  did  Master  Phiphi  say?" 

"Nothing.  I  think  he  was  jealous." 

"Would  George  give  you  the  letters?" 

"If  necessary  I'll  get  him  to.  I  don't  want  to  take  them  from 
him.  He'll  give  them  if  Phiphi  joins  in,  too.  They  each  of  them 
egg  the  other  on." 

"That's  what  goes  by  the  name  of  emulation.  And  you  don't 
see  anyone  else  at  the  school?" 

"I'll  look  about." 

"One  thing  more  I  wanted  to  say.  ...  I  think  there  must  be 
a  little  boy  called  Boris  amongst  the  boarders.  You're  to  leave 
him  alone";  he  paused  a  moment  and  then  added  in  a  whis- 
per: "for  the  moment." 

Olivier  and  Bernard  are  seated  at  a  table  in  one  of  the 
Boulevard  restaurants.  Olivier's  unhappiness  melts  like  hoar- 
frost in  the  warmth  of  his  friend's  smile.  Bernard  avoids  pro- 
nouncing Passavant's  name;  Olivier  feels  it;  a  secret  instinct 
warns  him;  but  the  name  is  on  the  tip  of  his  tongue;  he  must 
speak,  come  what  may. 

"Yes;  I  didn't  let  my  people  know  we  were  coming  back  so 
soon.  This  evening  the  Argonauts  are  giving  a  dinner.  Passavant 
particularly  wants  me  to  be  present.  He  wishes  our  new  review 
to  be  on  good  terms  with  its  elder  and  not  to  set  up  as  a  rival. 
.  .  .  You  ought  to  come;  and  I  tell  you  what  .  .  .  you  ought  to 
bring  Edouard.  .  .  .  Perhaps  not  to  dinner,  because  one's  got 
to  be  invited,  but  immediately  after.  It's  to  be  in  the  upstairs 
room  of  the  Taverne  du  Pantheon.  The  principal  members  of 
the  Argonaut  staff  will  be  there  and  a  good  many  of  our  own 


251  OLIVIER   MEETS   BERNARD 

Vanguard  contributors.  Our  first  number  is  nearly  ready;  but,  I 
say,  why  didn't  you  send  me  anything?" 

"Because  I  hadn't  anything  ready,"  he  answers  rather  curtly. 

Olivier's  voice  becomes  almost  imploring : 

"I  put  your  name  down  next  to  mine  in  the  list  of  contents. 
.  .  .  We  could  wait  a  little,  if  necessary  ...  no  matter  what; 
anything.  .  .  .  You  had  almost  promised." 

It  grieves  Bernard  to  hurt  his  friend;  but  he  hardens  himself: 

"Look  here,  old  boy,  I  had  better  tell  you  at  once — I'm  afraid 
I  shouldn't  hit  it  off  with  Passavant  very  well." 

"But  it's  1  who  am  the  editor.  He  leaves  me  perfectly  free." 

"And  then  I  dislike  the  idea  of  sending  you  710  matter  what; 
I  don't  want  to  write  no  matter  what." 

"\  said  no  matter  what,  because  I  knew  that  no  matter  what 
you  wrote  would  be  good  .  .  .  that  it  would  never  really  be 
no  matter  what." 

He  doesn't  know  what  to  say.  He  is  just  floundering.  If  he 
cannot  feel  his  friend  beside  him,  all  his  interest  in  the  review 
vanishes.  It  had  been  such  a  delightful  dream,  this  of  making 
their  debut  together. 

"And  then,  old  fellow,  if  I'm  beginning  to  know  what  I  don't 
want  to  do,  I  don't  know  yet  what  I  do  want  to  do.  I  don't  even 
know  whether  I  shall  write." 

This  declaration  fills  Olivier  with  consternation.  But  Bernard 
goes  on : 

"Nothing  that  I  could  write  easily  tempts  me.  It's  because  I 
can  turn  my  sentences  easily  that  I  have  a  detestation  of  well- 
turned  sentences.  Not  that  1  like  difficulty  for  its  own  sake; 
but  I  really  do  think  that  writers  of  the  present  time  take 
things  a  bit  too  easy.  I  don't  know  enough  about  other  people's 
lives  to  write  a  novel;  and  I  haven't  yet  had  a  life  of  my  own. 
Poetry  bores  me.  The  alexandrine  is  worn  threadbare;  the  vers 
libre  is  formless.  The  only  poet  who  satisfies  me  nowadays  is 
Rimbaud." 

"That's  exactly  what  I  say  in  our  manifesto." 

"Then  it's  not  worth  while  my  repeating  it.  No,  old  bt^y;  no; 
I  don't  know  whether  I  shall  write.  It  sometimes  seems  to  me 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  252 

that  writing  prevents  one  from  living,  and  that  one  can  express 
oneself  better  by  acts  than  by  words." 

"Works  of  art  are  acts  that  endure,"  ventured  Olivier  timidly; 
but  Bernard  was  not  listening. 

"That's  what  I  admire  most  of  all  in  Rimbaud — to  have 
preferred  life." 

"He  made  a  mess  of  his  own." 

"What  do  you  know  about  it?" 

"Oh!  really,  old  boy!  .  .  ." 

"One  can't  judge  other  people's  lives  from  the  outside.  But 
anyhow,  let's  grant  he  was  a  failure;  with  ill-luck,  poverty,  ill- 
ness to  bear.  .  .  .  Even  so,  1  envy  him  his  life;  yes,  I  envy  it 
more — even  with  its  sordid  ending — more  than  the  life  of  .  .  ." 

Bernard  did  not  finish  his  sentence;  on  the  point  of  naming  an 
illustrious  contemporary,  he  hesitated  between  too  many  of 
them.  He  shrugged  his  shoulders  and  went  on : 

"I  have  a  confused  feeling  in  myself  of  extraordinary  aspira- 
tions, surgings,  stirrings,  incomprehensible  agitations,  which  I 
don't  want  to  understand — which  I  don't  even  want  to  observe, 
for  fear  of  preventing  them.  Not  so  long  ago,  I  was  constantly 
talking  to  myself.  Now,  even  if  I  wanted  to,  1  shouldn't  be  able 
to.  It  was  a  mania  that  came  to  an  end  suddenly,  without  my 
even  being  aware  of  it.  I  think  that  this  habit  of  soliloquizing 
— of  inward  dialogue,  as  our  professor  used  to  call  it — neces- 
sitated a  kind  of  division  of  the  personality,  which  I  ceased  to 
be  capable  of,  the  day  that  I  began  to  love  someone  else  bet- 
ter than  myself." 

"You  mean  Laura,"  said  Olivier.  "Do  you  still  love  her  as 
much  as  ever?" 

"No,"  said  Bernard;  "more  than  ever.  I  think  it's  the  special 
quality  of  love  not  to  be  able  to  remain  stationary,  to  be 
obliged  to  increase  under  pain  of  diminishing;  and  that's  what 
distinguishes  it  from  friendship." 

"Friendship,  too,  can  grow  less,"  said  Olivier  sadly. 

"I  think  that  the  margins  of  friendship  aren't  so  wide." 

"I  say  .  .  .  you  won't  be  angry  if  I  ask  you  something?" 

"Try." 


253  OLIVIER   MEETS   BERNARD 

"I  don't  want  to  make  you  angry." 

"If  you  keep  your  questions  to  yourself,  you'll  make  me  more 
angry  still." 

"I  want  to  know  whether  you  feel  .  .  .  desire  for  Laura." 

Bernard  suddenly  became  very  grave. 

"If  it  weren't  you  .  .  ."  he  began.  "Well,  old  boy,  it's  a 
curious  thing  that's  happened  to  me :  ever  since  I  have  come  to 
know  her,  all  my  desires  have  gone;  I  have  none  left  at  all. 
You  remember  in  the  old  days  how  I  used  to  be  all  fire  and 
flame  for  twenty  women  at  once  whom  I  happened  to  pass  by 
in  the  street  (and  that's  the  very  thing  that  prevented  me  from 
choosing  any  one  of  them) ;  well,  now  it  seems  to  me  that  I  shall 
never  be  touched  again  by  any  other  form  of  beauty  than  hers; 
that  I  shall  never  be  able  to  love  any  other  forehead  than  hers; 
her  lips,  her  eyes.  But  what  I  feel  for  her  is  veneration;  when 
I  am  with  her  every  carnal  thought  seems  an  impiety.  I  think 
I  was  mistaken  about  myself,  and  that  in  reality  I  am  very 
chaste  by  nature.  Thanks  to  Laura,  my  instincts  have  been 
sublimated.  1  feel  I  have  within  me  great  unemployed  forces. 
I  should  like  to  make  them  take  up  service.  I  envy  the  Car- 
thusian who  bends  his  pride  to  the  rule  of  his  order;  the  person 
to  whom  one  says:  "I  count  upon  you."  I  envy  the  soldier.  ... 
Or  rather,  no;  I  envy  no  one;  but  the  turbulence  I  feel  within 
me  oppresses  me  and  my  aspiration  is  to  discipline  it.  It's  like 
steam  inside  me;  it  may  whistle  as  it  escapes  (that's  poetry), 
put  in  motion  wheels  and  pistons;  or  even  burst  the  engine.  Do 
you  know  the  act  which  I  sometimes  think  would  express  me 
best?  It's  ...  Oh!  I  know  well  enough  I  shan't  kill  myself; 
but  I  understand  Dmitri  Karamazof  perfectly  when  he  asks  his 
brother  if  he  understands  a  person  killing  himself  out  of  en- 
thusiasm, out  of  sheer  excess  of  life  .  .  .  just  bursting." 

An  extraordinary  radiance  shone  from  his  whole  being.  How 
well  he  expressed  himself!  Olivier  gazed  at  him  in  a  kind  of 
ecstasy. 

"So  do  I,"  he  murmured  timidly,  "I  understand  killing  one- 
self too;  but  it  would  be  after  having  tasted  a  joy  so  great, 
that  all  one's  life  to  come  would  seem  pale  beside  it;  a  joy  so 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  254 

great,  that  it  would  make  one  feel:  'I  have  had  enough.  I  am 
content;  never  again  shall  I  .  .  .' " 

But  Bernard  was  not  listening.  He  stopped.  What  was  the  use 
of  talking  to  empty  air?  All  his  sky  clouded  over  again.  Bernard 
took  out  his  watch: 

"I  must  be  off.  Well  then,  this  evening,  you  say?  .  .  .  What 
time?" 

"Oh,  I  should  think  ten  would  be  early  enough.  Will  you 
come?" 

"Yes.  I'll  try  to  bring  Edouard,  too.  But  you  know  he  doesn't 
much  care  for  Passavant;  and  literary  gatherings  bore  him.  It 
would  only  be  to  see  you.  1  say,  can't  we  meet  somewhere  after 
my  Latin  paper?"  Olivier  did  not  immediately  answer.  He  re- 
flected with  despair  that  he  had  promised  to  meet  Passavant 
that  afternoon  at  the  printer's  to  talk  over  the  printing  of  the 
Vanguard.  What  would  he  not  have  given  to  be  free? 

"I  should  like  to,  but  I'm  engaged." 

No  trace  of  his  unhappiness  was  apparent;  and  Bernard  an- 
swered : 

"Oh,  well,  it  doesn't  matter." 

And  at  that  the  two  friends  parted. 


Olivier  had  said  nothing  to  Bernard  of  all  he  had  meant  and 
hoped  to  say.  He  was  afraid  Bernard  had  taken  a  dislike  to 
him.  He  took  a  dislike  to  himself.  He,  so  gay,  so  smart  that 
morning,  walked  now  with  lowered  head.  Passavant's  friend- 
ship, of  which  at  first  he  had  been  so  proud,  began  to  be  irk- 
some to  him;  for  he  felt  Bernard's  reprobation  weighing  upon 
it.  Even  if  he  were  to  meet  his  friend  at  the  dinner  that  evening, 
he  would  be  unable  to  speak  to  him  in  front  of  all  those  people. 
He  would  be  unable  to  enjoy  the  dinner  if  they  had  not  come 
to  an  understanding  beforehand.  And  what  an  unfortunate  idea 
his  vanity  had  suggested  to  him  of  trying  to  get  Uncle  Edouard 
to  come  too!  There,  in  the  presence  of  Passavant,  surrounded 
by  elder  men,  by  other  writers,  by  the  future  contributors  to 
the  Vanguard,  he  would  be  obliged  to  show  off.  Edouard  would 


255  OLIVIER  MEETS   BERNARD 

misjudge  him  still  more — misjudge  him  no  doubt  irrevocably. 
...  If  only  he  could  see  him  before  this  evening!  ...  see  him 
at  once;  he  would  fling  his  arms  round  his  neck;  he  would  cry 
perhaps;  he  would  tell  all  his  troubles.  .  .  .  From  now  till  four 
o'clock,  he  has  the  time.  Quick!  a  taxi. 

He  gives  the  address  to  the  chauffeur.  He  reaches  the  door 
with  a  beating  heart;  he  rings.  .  .  .  Edouard  is  out. 

Poor  Olivier!  Instead  of  hiding  from  his  parents,  why  did 
he  not  simply  return  home?  He  would  have  found  his  Uncle 
Edouard  sitting  with  his  mother. 


EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL  :    MADAME   MOLINIER 

Those  novelists  deceive  us  who  show  the  individual's  develop- 
ment without  taking  into  account  the  pressure  of  surroundings. 
The  forest  fashions  the  tree.  To  each  one  how  small  a  place  is 
given!  How  many  buds  are  atrophied!  One  shoots  one's 
branches  where  one  can.  The  mystic  bough  is  due  more  often 
than  not  to  stifling.  The  only  escape  is  upwards.  I  cannot  under- 
stand how  Pauline  manages  not  to  grow  a  mystic  bough,  nor 
what  further  pressure  she  needs.  She  has  talked  to  me  more  in- 
timately than  ever  before.  I  did  not  suspect,  I  confess,  the 
amount  of  disillusionment  and  resignation  she  hides  beneath 
the  appearance  of  happiness.  But  I  recognize  that  she  would 
have  had  to  have  a  very  vulgar  nature  not  to  have  been  dis- 
appointed in  Molinier.  In  my  conversation  with  her  the  day 
before  yesterday,  I  was  able  to  gauge  his  limits.  How  in  the 
world  could  Pauline  have  married  him?  .  .  .  Alas!  the  most 
lamentable  lack  of  all — lack  of  character — is  a  hidden  one,  to 
be  revealed  only  by  time  and  usage. 

Pauline  puts  all  her  efforts  into  palliating  Oscar's  insuffi- 
ciencies and  weaknesses,  into  hiding  them  from  everyone; 
and  especially  from  his  children.  Her  utmost  ingenuity  is  em- 
ployed in  enabling  them  to  respect  their  father;  and  she  is  really 
hard  put  to  it;  but  she  does  it  in  such  a  way  that  I  myself 
was  deceived.  She  speaks  of  her  husband  without  contempt,  but 
with  a  kind  of  indulgence  which  is  expressive  enough.  She  de- 
plores his  want  of  authority  over  the  boys;  and,  as  I  expressed 
my  regrets  at  Olivier's  being  with  Passavant,  I  understood  that 
if  it  had  depended  on  her,  the  trip  to  Corsica  would  not  have 
taken  place. 

"I  didn't  approve  of  it,"  she  said,  "and  to  tell  you  the  truth. 


257  MADAME   MOLINIER 

I  don't  much  care  about  that  Monsieur  Passavant.  But  what 
could  I  do?  When  I  see  that  I  can't  prevent  a  thing,  I  prefer 
granting  it  with  a  good  grace.  As  for  Oscar,  he  always  gives  in ; 
he  gives  in  to  me,  too.  But  when  I  think  it's  my  duty  to  op- 
pose any  plan  of  the  children's — stand  out  against  them  in  any 
way,  he  never  supports  me  in  the  least.  On  this  occasion  Vincent 
stepped  in  as  well.  After  that,  how  could  I  oppose  Olivier 
without  risking  the  loss  of  his  confidence?  And  it's  that  I  care 
about  most." 

She  was  darning  old  socks — the  socks,  I  said  to  myself,  which 
were  no  longer  good  enough  for  Olivier.  She  stopped  to  thread 
her  needle,  and  then  went  on  again  in  a  lower  voice,  more 
confidingly  and  more  sadly: 

"His  confidence.  ...  If  I  were  only  sure  I  still  had  it.  But 
no;  I've  lost  it.  .  .  ." 

The  protest  I  attempted — without  conviction — made  her 
smile.  She  dropped  her  work  and  went  on : 

"For  instance,  I  know  he  is  in  Paris.  George  met  him  this 
morning;  he  mentioned  it  casually,  and  I  pretended  not  to  hear, 
for  I  don't  like  him  to  tell  tales  about  his  brother.  But  still 
I  know  it.  Olivier  hides  things  from  me.  When  I  see  him  again, 
he  will  think  himself  obliged  to  lie  to  me,  and  I  shall  pretend 
to  believe  him,  as  I  pretend  to  believe  his  father  every  time  he 
hides  things  from  me." 

"It's  for  fear  of  paining  you." 

"He  pains  me  a  great  deal  more  as  it  is.  I  am  not  intolerant. 
There  are  a  number  of  little  shortcomings  that  I  tolerate,  that 
I  shut  my  eyes  to." 

"Of  whom  are  you  talking  now?" 

"Oh!  of  the  father  as  well  as  the  sons." 

"When  you  pretend  not  to  see  them,  you  are  lying  too." 

"But  what  am  I  to  do?  It's  enough  not  to  complain.  I  really 
can't  approve!  No,  I  say  to  myself  that,  sooner  or  later,  one 
loses  hold,  that  the  tenderest  aff'ection  is  helpless.  More  than 
that.  It's  in  the  way;  it's  a  nuisance.  I  have  come  to  the  pitch 
of  hiding  my  love  itself." 

"Now  you  are  talking  of  your  sons." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  258 

"Why  do  you  say  that?  Do  you  mean  that  I  can't  love  Oscar 
any  more?  Sometimes  I  think  so,  but  I  think  too  that  it's  for 
fear  of  suffering  too  much  that  I  don't  love  him  more.  And.  .  . 
Yes,  I  suppose  you  are  right — in  Olivier's  case,  I  prefer  to 
suffer." 

"And  Vincent?" 

"A  few  years  ago  everything  I  now  say  of  Olivier  would  have 
been  true  of  Vincent." 

"My  poor  friend.  .  .  .  Soon  you  will  be  saying  the  same  of 
George." 

"But  one  becomes  resigned,  slowly.  And  yet  one  didn't  ask 
so  much  of  life.  One  learns  to  ask  less  .  .  .  less  and  less."  Then 
she  added  softly:  "And  of  oneself,  more  and  more." 

"With  ideas  of  that  kind,  one  is  almost  a  Christian,"  said 
I,  smiling  in  my  turn. 

"I  sometimes  think  so  too.  But  having  them  isn't  enough  to 
make  one  a  Christian." 

"Any  more  than  being  a  Christian  is  enough  to  make  one 
have  them." 

"I  have  often  thought — will  you  let  me  say  so? — that  in  their 
father's  default,  you  might  speak  to  the  boys." 

"Vincent  is  not  here." 

"It  is  too  late  for  him.  I  am  thinking  of  Olivier.  It's  with 
you  that  I  should  have  liked  him  to  go  away." 

At  these  words,  which  gave  me  the  sudden  imagination  of 
what  might  have  been  if  I  had  not  so  thoughtlessly  listened 
to  the  appeal  of  passing  adventure,  a  dreadful  emotion  wrung 
my  heart,  and  at  first  I  could  find  nothing  to  say;  then,  as  the 
tears  started  to  my  eyes,  and  wishing  to  give  some  appearance 
of  a  motive  to  my  disturbance: 

"Too  late,  I  fear,  for  him  too,"  I  sighed. 

Pauline  seized  my  hand: 

"How  good  you  are!"  she  cried. 

Embarrassed  at  seeing  her  thus  mistake  me,  and  unable  to 
undeceive  her,  I  could  only  turn  aside  the  conversation  from 
a  subject  which  put  me  too  ill  at  my  ease. 

"And  George?"  I  asked. 


259  MADAME   MOLINIER 

"He  makes  me  more  anxious  than  the  other  two  put  to- 
gether," she  answered.  "I  can't  say  that  with  him  I  am  losing 
my  hold,  for  he  has  never  been  either  confiding  or  obedient." 

She  hesitated  a  few  moments.  It  obviously  cost  her  a  great 
deal  to  say  what  follows. 

"This  summer  something  very  serious  happened,"  she  went 
on  at  last,  "something  it's  a  little  painful  for  me  to  speak  to 
you  about,  especially  as  I  am  still  not  very  sure.  ...  A 
hundred-franc  note  disappeared  from  a  cupboard  in  which  1 
was  in  the  habit  of  keeping  my  money.  The  fear  of  being  wrong 
in  my  suspicions  prevented  me  from  bringing  any  accusation; 
the  maid  who  waited  on  us  at  the  hotel  was  a  very  young  girl 
and  seemed  to  me  honest.  I  said  I  had  lost  the  note  before 
George;  I  might  as  well  admit  that  my  suspicions  fell  upon 
him.  He  didn't  appear  disturbed;  he  didn't  blush.  ...  I  felt 
ashamed  of  having  suspected  him;  I  tried  to  persuade  myself 
I  had  made  a  mistake.  I  did  my  accounts  over  again;  unfor- 
tunately there  was  no  possibility  of  a  doubt — a  hundred  francs 
were  missing.  I  shrank  from  questioning  him,  and  finally  I 
didn't.  The  fear  of  seeing  him  add  a  lie  to  a  theft  kept  me 
back.  Was  I  wrong?  .  .  .  Yes,  I  reproach  myself  now  for  not 
having  insisted;  perhaps  it  was  out  of  a  fear  that  I  should  have 
to  be  too  severe — or  that  I  shouldn't  be  severe  enough.  Once 
again,  I  played  the  part  of  a  person  who  knows  nothing,  but 
with  a  very  anxious  heart,  I  assure  you.  I  had  let  the  time  go 
by,  and  I  said  to  myself  it  was  too  late  and  that  the  punishment 
would  come  too  long  after  the  fault.  And  how  punish  him?  I 
did  nothing;  I  reproach  myself  for  it  .  .  .  but  what  could  I 
have  done? 

"I  had  thought  of  sending  him  to  England;  I  even  wanted  to 
ask  your  advice  about  it,  but  I  didn't  know  where  you  were. 
...  At  any  rate,  I  didn't  hide  my  trouble  from  him — my  anx- 
iety; I  think  he  must  have  felt  it,  for,  you  know,  he  has  a  good 
heart.  I  count  more  on  his  own  conscience  to  reproach  him  than 
on  anything  I  could  have  said.  He  won't  do  it  again,  I  feel  cer- 
tain. He  used  to  go  about  with  a  very  rich  boy  at  the  sea-side, 
and  he  was  no  doubt  led  on  to  spend  money.  No  doubt  I  must 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  260 

have  left  the  cupboard  open;  and  I  repeat,  I'm  not  really  sure 
it  was  he.  There  were  a  great  many  people  coming  and  going 
in  the  hotel.  .  .  ." 

I  admired  the  ingenious  way  in  which  she  put  forward  every 
possible  consideration  that  might  exonerate  her  child. 

"I  should  have  liked  him  to  put  the  money  back,"  I  said. 

"I  hoped  he  would.  And  when  he  didn't,  I  thought  it  must 
be  a  proof  of  his  innocence.  And  then  I  said  to  myself  that  he 
was  afraid  to." 

"Did  you  tell  his  father?" 

She  hesitated  a  few  moments: 

"No,"  she  said  at  last,  "1  prefer  him  to  know  nothing  about 
it." 

No  doubt  she  thought  she  heard  a  noise  in  the  next  room;  she 
went  to  make  sure  there  was  no  one  there;  then  she  sat  down 
again  beside  me. 

"Oscar  told  me  you  lunched  together  the  other  day.  He  was 
so  loud  in  your  praise,  that  I  suppose  what  you  chiefly  did  was 
to  listen  to  him."  (She  smiled  sadly,  as  she  said  these  words.) 
"If  he  confided  in  you,  I  have  no  desire  not  to  respect  his  con- 
fidences .  .  .  though  in  reality  I  know  a  great  deal  more  about 
his  private  life  than  he  imagines.  But  since  I  got  back,  I  can't 
understand  what  has  come  over  him.  He  is  so  gentle — I  was  al- 
most going  to  say — so  humble.  .  .  .  It's  almost  embarrassing. 
He  goes  on  as  if  he  were  afraid  of  me.  He  needn't  be.  For  a  long 
time  past  I've  been  aware  that  he  has  been  carrying  on.  .  .  . 
I  even  know  with  whom.  He  thinks  I  know  nothing  about  it 
and  takes  enormous  pains  to  hide  it;  but  his  precautions  are 
so  obvious,  that  the  more  he  hides,  the  more  he  gives  himself 
away.  Every  time  he  goes  out  with  an  affectation  of  being  busy, 
worried,  anxious,  I  know  that  he  is  off  to  his  pleasure.  I  feel 
inclined  to  say  to  him:  'But,  my  dear  friend,  I'm  not  keeping 
you;  are  you  afraid  I'm  jealous?'  I  should  laugh  if  I  had  the 
heart  to.  My  only  fear  is  that  the  children  may  notice  some- 
thing; he's  so  careless — so  clumsy!  Sometimes,  without  his  sus- 
pecting it,  I  find  myself  forced  to  help  him,  as  if  I  were  playing 
his  game.  I  assure  you  I  end  by  being  almost  amused  by  it;  I

invent  excuses  for  him;  I  put  the  letters  he  leaves  lying  about 
back  in  his  coat  pocket." 

"That's  just  it,"  1  said;  "he's  afraid  you  have  discovered  some 
letters." 

"Did  he  tell  you  so?" 

"And  that's  what's  making  him  so  nervous." 

"Do  you  think  I  want  to  read  them?" 

A  kind  of  wounded  pride  made  her  draw  herself  up.  I  was 
obliged  to  add: 

"It's  not  a  question  of  the  letters  he  may  have  mislaid  in- 
advertently; but  of  some  letters  he  had  put  in  a  drawer  and 
which  he  says  he  can't  find.  He  thinks  you  have  taken  them." 

At  these  words,  I  saw  Pauline  turn  pale,  and  the  horrible  sus- 
picion which  darted  upon  her,  forced  itself  suddenly  into  my 
mind  too.  1  regretted  having  spoken,  but  it  was  too  late.  She 
looked  away  from  me  and  murmured: 

"Would  to  Heaven  it  were  1 1" 

She  seemed  overcome. 

"What  am  1  to  do?"  she  repeated.  "What  am  I  to  do?"  Then 
raising  her  eyes  to  mine  again:  "You?  Couldn't  you  speak  to 
him?" 

Although  she  avoided,  as  I  did,  pronouncing  George's  name, 
it  was  clear  that  she  was  thinking  of  him. 

"I  will  try.  I  will  think  it  over,"  I  said,  rising.  And  as  she 
accompanied  me  to  the  front  door: 

"Say  nothing  about  it  to  Oscar,  please.  Let  him  go  on  sus- 
pecting me — thinking  what  he  thinks.  ...  It  is  better  so. 
Come  and  see  me  again."

OLIVIER  AND  ARMAND 

In  the  mean  time  Olivier,  deeply  disappointed  at  not  having 
found  his  Uncle  Edouard,  and  unable  to  bear  his  solitude, 
turned  his  thoughts  towards  Armand  with  a  heart  aching  for 
friendship.  He  made  his  way  to  the  Pension  Vedel. 

Armand  received  him  in  his  bedroom.  It  was  a  small,  narrow 
room,  reached  by  the  backstairs.  Its  window  looked  on  to  an 
inner  courtyard,  on  to  which  the  water-closets  and  kitchens  of 
the  next-door  house  opened  also.  The  light  came  from  a  cor- 
rugated zinc  reflector,  which  caught  it  from  above  and  cast  it 
down,  pallid,  leaden  and  dreary.  The  room  was  badly  ven- 
tilated; an  unpleasant  odour  pervaded  it. 

"But  one  gets  accustomed  to  it,"  said  Armand.  "My  parents, 
you  understand,  keep  the  best  rooms  for  the  boarders  who  pay 
best.  It's  only  natural.  I  have  given  up  the  room  I  had  last 
year  to  a  Vicomte — the  brother  of  your  illustrious  friend  Passa- 
vant.  A  princely  room — but  under  the  observation  of  Rachel's. 
There  are  heaps  of  rooms  here,  but  not  all  of  them  are  inde- 
pendent. For  instance,  poor  Sarah,  who  came  back  from  Eng- 
land this  morning,  is  obliged  to  pass,  either  through  our  par- 
ents' room  (which  doesn't  suit  her  at  all)  to  get  to  her  new 
abode,  or  else  through  mine,  which,  truth  to  tell,  is  really  noth- 
ing but  a  dressing-room  or  box-room.  At  any  rate,  I  have  the 
advantage  here  of  being  able  to  go  out  and  in  as  I  please,  with- 
out being  spied  upon  by  anyone.  I  prefer  that  to  the  attics, 
where  the  servants  live.  To  tell  the  truth,  I  rather  like  being 
uncomfortably  lodged;  my  father  would  call  it  the  'love  of 
maceration,'  and  would  explain  that  what  is  hurtful  to  the  body 
leads  to  the  salvation  of  the  soul.  For  that  matter,  he  has  never 
been  inside  the  place.  He  has  other  things  to  do,  you  understand. 


263  OLIVIER  AND   ARMAND 

than  worrying  over  his  son's  habitat.  My  papa's  a  wonderful 
fellow.  He  has  by  heart  a  number  of  consoling  phrases  for  the 
principal  events  of  life.  It's  magnificent  to  hear  him.  A  pity  he 
never  has  any  time  for  a  little  chat.  .  .  .  You're  looking  at  my 
picture  gallery;  one  can  enjoy  it  better  in  the  morning.  That 
is  a  colour  print  by  a  pupil  of  Paolo  Ucelli's — for  the  use 
of  veterinaries.  In  an  admirable  attempt  at  synthesis,  the  artist 
has  concentrated  on  a  single  horse  all  the  ills  by  means  of 
which  Providence  chastens  the  equine  soul;  you  observe  the 
spirituality  of  the  look.  .  .  .  That  is  a  symbolical  picture  of  the 
ages  of  life  from  the  cradle  to  the  grave.  As  a  drawing,  not  much 
can  be  said  for  it;  its  chief  value  lies  in  its  intention.  Further 
on  you  will  note  with  admiration  the  photograph  of  one  of 
Titian's  courtesans,  which  I  have  put  over  my  bed  in  order 
to  give  myself  libidinous  thoughts.  That  is  the  door  into  Sarah's 
room." 

The  almost  sordid  aspect  of  the  place  made  a  melancholy 
impression  on  Olivier;  the  bed  was  not  made  and  the  basin  on 
the  wash-stand  was  not  emptied. 

"Yes,  I  fix  up  my  room  myself,"  said  Armand,  in  response 
to  his  anxious  look.  "Here,  you  see,  is  my  writing  table.  You 
have  no  idea  how  the  atmosphere  of  the  room  inspires  me.  .  .  . 
'L'atmosphere  d'lm  cher  reduit.  .  .  .'  I  even  owe  it  the  idea  of 
my  last  poem — The  Nocturnal  Vase." 

Olivier  had  come  to  see  Armand  with  the  intention  of  speak- 
ing about  his  review  and  asking  him  to  contribute  to  it;  he  no 
longer  dared  to.  But  Armand's  own  conversation  was  coming 
round  to  the  subject. 

"The  Nocturnal  Vase — eh?  What  a  magnificent  title!  .  .  . 
With  this  motto  from  Baudelaire: 

'Funereal  vase,  what  tears  awaitest  thou?'  i 

Baudelaire. 

"I  take  up  once  more  the  ancient  (and  ever  young)  compar- 
ison of  the  potter  creator,  who  fashions  every  human  being  as 
a  vase  destined  to  hold — ah!  what?  And  I  compare  myself  in  a 

1  Es-tu  vase  funebre  attendant  quelques  pleurs? 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  264 

lyrical  outburst  to  the  above-mentioned  vase — an  idea  which, 
as  I  was  telling  you,  came  to  me  as  the  natural  result  of  breath- 
ing the  odour  of  this  chamber.  I  am  particularly  pleased  with 
the  opening  line: 

'Whoe'er  at  forty  boasts  no  hemorrhoids  .  .  ' 

I  had  first  of  all  written,  in  order  to  reassure  the  reader,  'Who- 
e'er at  fifty  .  .  .'  but  I  should  have  missed  the  assonance.  As 
for  'hemorrhoids,'  it  is  undoubtedly  the  finest  word  in  the 
French  language — independently  of  its  meaning,"  he  added  with 
a  saturnine  laugh. 

Olivier,  a  pain  at  his  heart,  kept  silent.  Armand  went  on : 

"Needless  to  say,  the  night  vase  is  particularly  flattered  when 
it  receives  a  visit  from  a  pot  filled  with  aromatics  like  yourself." 

"And  haven't  you  written  anything  but  that?"  asked  Olivier 
at  last,  desperately. 

"I  was  going  to  offer  my  Nocturnal  Vase  to  your  great  and 
glorious  review,  but  from  the  tone  in  which  you  have  just  said 
'that,'  I  see  there  isn't  much  likelihood  of  its  pleasing  you.  In 
such  cases  the  poet  always  has  the  resource  of  arguing:  'I  don't 
write  to  please,'  and  of  persuading  himself  that  he  has  brought 
forth  a  master-piece.  But  I  cannot  conceal  from  you  that  1  con- 
sider my  poem  execrably  bad.  For  that  matter,  I  have  so  far 
only  written  the  first  line.  And  when  I  say  written,  it's  a  figure 
of  speech,  for  I  have  this  very  moment  composed  it  in  your 
honour.  .  .  .  No,  really?  were  you  thinking  of  publishing  some- 
thing of  mine?  You  actually  desired  my  collaboration?  You 
judged  me,  then,  not  incapable  of  writing  something  decent? 
Can  you  have  discerned  on  my  pale  brow  the  revealing  stigmata 
of  genius?  I  know  the  light  here  is  not  very  favourable  for  look- 
ing at  oneself  in  the  glass,  but  when — like  another  Narcissus — 
I  gaze  at  my  reflection,  I  can  see  nothing  but  the  features 
of  a  failure.  After  all,  perhaps  it's  an  effect  of  chiaroscuro.  .  .  . 
No,  my  dear  Olivier,  no;  I  have  done  nothing  this  summer,  and 
if  you  are  counting  on  me  for  your  review,  you  may  go  to 
blazes.  But  that's  enough  about  me.  .  .  .  Did  all  go  well  in 


265  OLIVIER  AND  ARMAND 

Corsica?  Did  you  enjoy  your  trip?  Did  it  do  you  good?  Did 
you  rest  after  your  labours?  Did  you  .  .  ." 

Olivier  could  bear  it  no  longer: 

"Oh!  do  shut  up,  old  boy.  Stop  playing  the  ass.  If  you  imag- 
ine I  think  it's  funny  .  .  ." 

"And  what  about  me?"  cried  Armand.  "No,  my  dear  fellow, 
no;  all  the  same  I'm  not  so  stupid  as  all  that.  I've  still  intelli- 
gence enough  to  understand  that  everything  I've  been  saying  is 
idiotic." 

"Can't  you  ever  talk  seriously?" 

"Very  well;  we'll  talk  seriously,  since  seriousness  is  the  style 
you  favour.  Rachel,  my  eldest  sister,  is  going  blind.  Her  sight 
has  been  getting  very  bad  lately.  For  the  last  two  years,  she 
hasn't  been  able  to  read  without  glasses.  I  thought  at  first  it 
would  be  all  right  if  she  were  to  change  them.  But  it  wasn't. 
At  my  request,  she  went  to  see  an  oculist.  It  seems  the  sensitive- 
ness of  the  retina  is  failing.  You  understand  there  are  two  very 
different  things — on  the  one  hand,  a  defective  power  of  accom- 
modation of  the  crystalline,  which  can  be  remedied  by  glasses. 
But  even  after  they  have  brought  the  visual  image  to  the  proper 
focus,  that  image  may  make  an  insufficient  impression  on  the 
retina  and  be  only  dimly  transmitted  to  the  brain.  Do  I  make 
myself  clear?  You  hardly  know  Rachel,  so  don't  imagine  that  I 
am  trying  to  arouse  your  pity  for  her.  Then  why  am  I  telling 
you  all  this?  .  .  .  Because,  reflecting  on  my  own  case,  I  be- 
came aware  that  not  only  images  but  ideas  may  strike  the  brain 
with  more  or  less  clearness.  A  person  with  a  dull  mind  receives 
only  confused  perceptions;  but  for  that  very  reason  he  cannot 
realize  clearly  that  he  is  dull.  He  would  only  begin  to  suffer 
from  his  stupidity  if  he  were  conscious  of  it;  and  in  order 
to  be  conscious  of  it,  he  would  have  to  become  intelligent.  Now 
imagine  for  a  moment  such  a  monster — an  imbecile  who  is  in- 
telligent enough  to  understand  that  he  is  stupid." 

"Why,  he  would  cease  to  be  an  imbecile." 

"No,  my  dear  fellow;  you  may  believe  me,  because  as  a 
matter  of  fact,  /  am  that  very  imbecile." 

Olivier  shrugged  his  shoulders.  Armand  went  on : 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  266 

"A  real  imbecile  has  no  consciousness  of  any  idea  beyond  his 
own.  /  am  conscious  of  the  beyond.  But  all  the  same  I'm  an  im- 
becile, because  I  know  that  I  shall  never  be  able  to  attain  that 
'beyond'!  .  .  ." 

"But,  old  fellow,"  said  Olivier,  in  a  burst  of  sympathy,  "we 
are  all  made  so  that  we  might  be  better,  and  I  think  the  great- 
est intelligence  is  precisely  the  one  that  suflFers  most  from  its 
own  limitations." 

Armand  shook  off  the  hand  that  Olivier  had  placed  affec- 
tionately on  his  arm. 

"Others,"  said  he,  "have  the  feeling  of  what  they  possess; 
I  have  only  the  feeling  of  what  I  lack.  Lack  of  money,  lack  of 
strength,  lack  of  intelligence,  lack  of  love — an  everlasting  def- 
icit. I  shall  never  be  anything  but  below  the  mark." 

He  went  up  to  the  toilette  table,  dipped  a  hairbrush  in  the 
dirty  water  in  the  basin  and  plastered  his  hair  down  in  hideous 
fashion  over  his  forehead. 

"I  told  you  I  hadn't  written  anything;  but  a  few  days  ago,  I 
did  have  an  idea  for  an  essay,  which  I  should  have  called: 
On  Incapacity.  But  of  course  I  was  incapable  of  writing  it.  I 
should  have  said.  .  .  But  I'm  boring  you." 

"No;  go  on;  you  bore  me  when  you  make  jokes;  you're  inter- 
esting me  very  much  now." 

"I  should  have  tried  to  find  throughout  nature  the  dividing 
line,  below  which  nothing  exists.  An  example  will  show  you 
what  I  mean.  The  newspapers  the  other  day  had  an  account  of 
a  workman  who  was  electrocuted.  He  was  handling  some  live 
wires  carelessly;  the  voltage  was  not  very  high;  but  it  seems 
his  body  was  in  a  state  of  perspiration.  His  death  is  attributed 
to  the  layer  of  humidity  which  enabled  the  current  to  envelop 
his  body.  If  his  body  had  been  drier,  the  accident  wouldn't 
have  taken  place.  But  now  let's  imagine  the  perspiration  added 
drop  by  drop.  .  .  .  One  more  drop — there  you  are!" 

"I  don't  understand,"  said  Olivier. 

"Because  my  example  is  badly  chosen.  I  always  choose  my 
examples  badly.  Here's  another:  Six  shipwrecked  persons  are 
picked  up  in  a  boat.  They  have  been  adrift  for  ten  days  in  the 


267  OLIVIER  AND   ARMAND 

storm.  Three  are  dead;  two  are  saved.  The  sixth  is  expiring. 
It  was  hoped  he  might  be  restored  to  life;  but  his  organism  had 
reached  the  extreme  limit." 

"Yes,  I  understand,"  said  Olivier.  "An  hour  sooner  and  he 
might  have  been  saved." 

"An  hour!  How  you  go  it!  I  am  calculating  the  extremest 
point.  It  is  possible.  It  is  still  possible.  ...  It  is  no  longer  pos- 
sible! My  mind  walks  along  that  narrow  ridge.  That  dividing 
line  between  existence  and  non-existence  is  the  one  I  keep  trying 
to  trace  everywhere.  The  limit  of  resistance  to — well,  for  in- 
stance, to  what  my  father  would  call  temptation.  One  holds  out; 
the  cord  on  which  the  devil  pulls  is  stretched  to  breaking.  .  ,  . 
A  tiny  bit  more,  the  cord  snaps — one  is  damned.  Do  you  under- 
stand now?  A  tiny  bit  less — non-existence.  God  would  not  have 
created  the  world.  Nothing  would  have  been.  'The  face  of  the 
world  would  have  been  changed,'  says  Pascal.  But  it's  not 
enough  for  me  to  think — 'if  Cleopatra's  nose  had  been  shorter.' 
I  insist.  I  ask:  shorter,  by  how  much?  For  it  might  have  been  a 
tiny  bit  shorter,  mightn't  it?  .  .  .  Gradation;  gradation;  and 
then  a  sudden  leap.  .  .  .  Natura  non  fecit  saltus.  What  absurd 
rubbish !  As  for  me,  I  am  like  the  Arab  in  the  desert  who  is  dy- 
ing of  thirst.  I  am  at  that  precise  point,  you  see,  when  a  drop 
of  water  might  still  save  him  ...  or  a  tear.  .  .  ." 

His  voice  trailed  away;  there  had  come  into  it  a  note  of 
pathos  which  surprised  Olivier  and  disturbed  him.  He  went  on 
more  gently — almost  tenderly: 

"You  remember:  'I  shed  that  very  tear  for  thee  .  .  .' " 

Olivier  remembered  Pascal's  words;  he  was  even  a  little  put 
out  that  his  friend  had  not  quoted  them  exactly.  He  could  not 
refrain  from  correcting:  "  'I  shed  that  very  drop  of  blood  for 
thee  .  .  .'" 

Armand's  emotion  dropped  at  once.  He  shrugged  his  shoul- 
ders: 

"What  can  we  do?  There  are  some  who  get  through  with 
more  than  enough  and  to  spare.  ...  Do  you  understand  now 
what  it  is  to  feel  that  one  is  always  'on  the  border  line'?  As  for 
me,  I  shall  always  have  one  mark  too  little." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  268 

He  had  begun  to  laugh  again.  Olivier  thought  that  it  was  for 
fear  of  crying.  He  would  have  liked  to  speak  in  his  turn,  to 
tell  Armand  how  much  his  words  had  moved  him,  and  how 
he  felt  all  the  sickness  of  heart  that  lay  beneath  his  exasperating 
irony.  But  the  time  for  his  rendezvous  with  Passavant  was 
pressing  him;  he  pulled  out  his  watch. 

"I  must  go  now.  Are  you  free  this  evening?" 

"What  for?" 

"To  come  and  meet  me  at  the  Taverne  du  Pantheon.  The 
Argonauts  are  giving  a  dinner.  You  might  look  in  afterwards. 
There'll  be  a  lot  of  fellows  there — some  of  them  more  or  less 
well  known — and  most  of  them  rather  drunk.  Bernard  Profiten- 
dieu  has  promised  to  come.  It  might  be  funny." 

"I'm  not  shaved,"  said  Armand  a  little  crossly.  "And  then 
what  should  I  do  among  a  lot  of  celebrities?  But,  I  say — why 
don't  you  ask  Sarah?  She  got  back  from  England  this  very 
morning.  I'm  sure  it  would  amuse  her.  Shall  I  invite  her  from 
you?  Bernard  could  take  her." 

"All  right,  old  chap,"  said  Olivier. 


VIII 

THE  ARGONAUTS'  DINNER 

It  had  been  agreed  then  that  Bernard  and  Edouard,  after  hav- 
ing dined  together,  should  pick  up  Sarah  a  little  before  ten 
o'clock.  She  had  delightedly  accepted  the  proposal  passed  on  to 
her  by  Armand.  At  about  half  past  nine,  she  had  gone  up  to 
her  bedroom,  accompanied  by  her  mother.  She  had  to  pass 
through  her  parents'  room  in  order  to  reach  hers;  but  another 
door,  which  was  supposed  to  be  kept  shut,  led  from  Sarah's 
room  to  Armand's,  which  in  its  turn  opened,  as  we  have  seen, 
on  to  the  backstairs, 

Sarah,  in  her  mother's  presence,  made  as  though  she  were 
going  to  bed,  and  asked  to  be  left  to  go  to  sleep;  but  as  soon 
as  she  was  alone,  she  went  up  to  her  dressing  table  to  put  an 
added  touch  of  brilliancy  to  her  lips  and  cheeks.  The  toilette 
table  had  been  placed  in  front  of  the  closed  door,  but  it  was  not 
too  heavy  for  Sarah  to  lift  noiselessly.  She  opened  the  door. 

Sarah  was  afraid  of  meeting  her  brother,  whose  sarcasms 
she  dreaded.  Armand,  it  is  true,  encouraged  her  most  audacious 
exploits;  it  was  as  though  he  took  pleasure  in  them — but  only 
with  a  kind  of  temporary  indulgence,  for  it  was  to  judge  them 
later  on  with  all  the  greater  severity;  so  that  Sarah  wondered 
whether  his  complaisance  itself  was  not  calculated  to  play  the 
censor's  game. 

Armand's  room  was  empty.  Sarah  sat  down  on  a  little  low 
chair  and,  as  she  was  waiting,  meditated.  She  cultivated  a  facile 
contempt  for  all  the  domestic  virtues  as  a  kind  of  preventive 
protest.  The  constraint  of  family  life  had  intensified  her  ener- 
gies and  exasperated  her  instinct  for  revolt.  During  her  stay 
in  England,  she  had  worked  herself  up  into  a  white  heat  of 
courage.  Like  Miss  Aberdeen,  the  English  girl  boarder,  she  was 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  270 

resolved  to  conquer  her  liberty,  to  grant  herself  every  license, 
to  dare  all.  She  felt  ready  to  affront  scorn  and  blame  on  every 
side,  capable  of  every  defiance.  In  the  advances  she  had  made 
to  Olivier,  she  had  already  triumphed  over  natural  modesty 
and  many  an  instinctive  reluctance.  The  example  of  her  two 
sisters  had  taught  her  her  lesson;  she  looked  upon  Rachel's 
pious  resignation  as  the  delusion  of  a  dupe,  and  saw  in  Laura's 
marriage  nothing  but  a  lugubrious  barter  with  slavery  as  its 
upshot.  The  education  she  had  received,  that  which  she  had 
given  herself,  that  which  she  had  taken,  inclined  her  very  little 
to  what  she  called  "conjugal  piety."  She  did  not  see  in  what 
particular  the  man  she  might  marry  could  be  her  superior. 
Hadn't  she  passed  her  examinations  like  a  man?  Hadn't  she  her 
opinions  and  ideas  on  any  and  every  subject?  On  the  equality 
of  the  sexes  in  particular;  and  it  even  seemed  to  her  that  in  the 
conduct  of  life,  and  consequently  of  business,  and  even,  if  need 
were,  of  politics,  women  often  gave  proof  of  more  sense  than 
many  men.  .  .  . 

Steps  on  the  staircase.  She  listened  and  then  opened  the  door 
gently. 

Bernard  and  Sarah  had  never  met.  There  was  no  light  in  the 
passage.  They  could  hardly  distinguish  each  other  in  the  dark. 

"Mademoiselle  Sarah  Vedel?"  whispered  Bernard.  She  took 
his  arm  without  more  ado. 

"Edouard  is  waiting  for  us  at  the  comer  of  the  street  in 
a  taxi.  He  didn't  want  to  get  down  for  fear  of  meeting  your 
parents.  It  didn't  matter  for  me;  you  know  I  am  staying  in  the 
house." 

Bernard  had  been  careful  to  leave  the  door  into  the  street 
ajar,  so  as  not  to  attract  the  porter's  attention.  A  few  minutes 
later,  the  taxi  deposited  them  all  three  in  front  of  the  Taverne 
du  Pantheon.  As  Edouard  was  paying  the  taxi,  they  heard  a 
clock  strike  ten. 

Dinner  was  finished.  The  table  had  been  cleared,  but  it  was 
still  covered  with  coffee-cups,  bottles  and  glasses.  Everyone  was 
smoking  and  the  atmosphere  was  stifling.  Madame  des  Brousses, 


271  THE  ARGONAUTS'   DINNER 

the  wife  of  the  editor  of  the  Argonauts,  called  for  fresh  air  in 
a  strident  voice,  which  rang  out  shrilly  above  the  hum  of  gen- 
eral talk.  Someone  opened  a  window.  But  Justinien,  who 
wanted  to  put  in  a  speech,  had  it  shut  almost  immediately  "for 
acoustics'  sake."  He  rose  to  his  feet  and  struck  on  his  glass 
with  a  spoon,  but  failed  to  attract  anyone's  attention.  The  edi- 
tor of  the  Argonauts,  whom  people  called  the  President  des 
Brousses,  interposed,  and  having  at  last  succeeded  in  obtaining 
a  modicum  of  silence,  Justinien's  voice  gushed  forth  in  a  copious 
stream  of  dullness.  A  flood  of  metaphors  covered  the  triteness 
of  his  ideas.  He  spoke  with  an  emphasis  v/hich  took  the  place  of 
wit,  and  managed  to  ladle  out  to  everyone  in  turn  a  hand- 
some helping  of  grandiloquent  flummery.  At  the  first  pause, 
and  just  as  Edouard,  Bernard  and  Sarah  were  making  their 
entry,  there  was  a  loud  burst  of  polite  applause.  Some  of  the 
company  prolonged  it,  no  doubt  a  little  ironically,  and  as  if 
hoping  to  put  an  end  to  the  speech;  but  in  vain — Justinien 
started  off  afresh;  nothing  could  daunt  his  eloquence.  At  that 
moment  it  was  the  Comte  de  Passavant  whom  he  was  bestrew- 
ing with  the  flowers  of  his  rhetoric.  He  spoke  of  The  Horiiontal 
Bar  as  of  another  Iliad.  Passavant's  health  was  drunk.  Edouard 
had  no  glass,  neither  had  Bernard  nor  Sarah,  so  that  they  were 
dispensed  from  joining  in  the  toast. 

Justinien's  speech  ended  with  a  few  heartfelt  wishes  for  the 
prosperity  of  the  new  review  and  a  few  elegant  compliments 
to  its  future  editor — "the  young  and  gifted  Molinier — the  dar- 
ling of  the  Muses,  whose  pure  and  lofty  brow  would  not  long 
have  to  wait  for  its  crown  of  laurels." 

Olivier  was  standing  near  the  door,  so  as  to  welcome  his 
friends  as  soon  as  they  should  arrive.  Justinien's  blatant  com- 
pliments obviously  embarrassed  him,  but  he  was  obliged  to 
respond  to  the  little  ovation  which  followed  them. 

The  three  new  arrivals  had  dined  too  soberly  to  feel  in  tune 
with  the  rest  of  the  assembly.  In  this  sort  of  gathering,  late 
comers  understand  ill — or  only  too  well — the  others'  excitement. 
They  judge,  when  they  have  no  business  to  judge,  and  exer- 
cise, even  though  involuntarily,  a  criticism  which  is  without 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  272 

indulgence;  this  was  the  case  at  any  rate  with  Edouard  and 
Bernard.  As  for  Sarah,  in  this  milieu,  everything  was  new  to 
her;  her  one  idea  was  to  learn  what  she  could,  her  one  anxiety 
to  be  up  to  the  mark. 

Bernard  knew  no  one.  Olivier,  who  had  taken  him  by  the 
arm,  wanted  to  introduce  him  to  Passavant  and  des  Brousses. 
He  refused.  Passavant,  however,  forced  the  situation  by  coming 
up  to  him  and  holding  out  a  hand,  which  he  could  not  in  de- 
cency refuse: 

"I  have  heard  you  spoken  of  so  often  that  I  feel  as  if  I 
knew  you  already." 

"The  same  with  me,"  said  Bernard  in  such  a  tone  that  Pas- 
savant's  amenity  froze.  He  at  once  turned  to  Edouard. 

Though  often  abroad  travelling,  and  keeping,  even  when  he 
was  in  Paris,  a  great  deal  to  himself,  Edouard  was  nevertheless 
acquainted  with  several  of  the  guests  and  feeling  perfectly  at 
his  ease.  Little  liked,  but  at  the  same  time  esteemed,  by  his 
confreres,  he  did  not  object  to  being  thought  proud,  when,  in 
reality,  he  was  only  distant.  He  was  more  willing  to  listen  than 
to  speak. 

"From  what  your  nephew  said,  I  was  hoping  you  would  come 
to-night,"  began  Passavant  in  a  gentle  voice  that  was  almost 
a  whisper.  "I  was  delighted  because  .  .  ." 

Edouard's  ironical  look  cut  short  the  rest  of  his  sentence. 
Skilful  in  the  arts  of  pleasing  and  accustomed  to  please,  Passa- 
vant, in  order  to  shine,  had  need  to  feel  himself  confronted  by 
a  flattering  mirror.  He  collected  himself,  however,  for  he  was 
not  the  man  to  lose  his  self-possession  for  long  or  to  let  himself 
be  easily  snubbed.  He  raised  his  head,  and  his  eyes  were  charged 
with  insolence.  If  Edouard  would  not  follow  his  lead  with  a 
good  grace,  he  would  find  means  to  worst  him. 

"I  was  wanting  to  ask  you  .  .  ."  he  went  on,  as  if  he  were 
continuing  his  first  remark,  "whether  you  had  any  news  of 
your  other  nephew,  Vincent?  It  was  he  who  was  my  special 
friend." 

"No,"  said  Edouard  dryly. 

This  "no"  upset  Passavant  once  more;   he  did  not  know 


273  THE  ARGONAUTS'   DINNER 

whether  to  take  it  as  a  provocative  contradiction,  or  as  a  simple 
answer  to  his  question.  His  disturbance  lasted  only  a  second;  it 
was  Edouard  who  unintentionally  restored  him  to  his  balance  by 
adding  almost  at  once: 

"I  have  merely  heard  from  his  father  that  he  was  travelling 
with  the  Prince  of  Monaco." 

"Yes,  I  asked  a  lady,  who  is  a  friend  of  mine,  to  introduce 
him  to  the  Prince.  I  was  glad  to  hit  upon  this  diversion  to 
distract  him  a  little  from  his  unlucky  affair  with  that  Madame 
Douviers.  .  .  .  You  know  her,  so  Olivier  told  me.  He  was  in 
danger  of  wrecking  his  whole  life  over  it." 

Passavant  handled  disdain,  contempt,  condescension  with 
marvellous  skill;  but  he  was  satisfied  with  having  won  this 
bout  and  with  keeping  Edouard  at  sword's  length.  Edouard  in- 
deed was  racking  his  brains  for  some  cutting  answer.  He  was 
singularly  lacking  in  presence  of  mind.  That  was  no  doubt  the 
reason  he  cared  so  little  for  society — he  had  none  of  the  qualities 
which  are  necessary  to  shine  in  it.  His  eyebrows  however  began 
to  look  frowningly.  Passavant  was  quick  to  notice;  when  any- 
thing disagreeable  was  coming  to  him,  he  sniffed  it  in  the  air, 
and  veered  about.  Without  even  stopping  to  take  breath,  and 
with  a  sudden  change  of  tone : 

"But  who  is  that  delightful  girl  who  is  with  you?"  he  asked 
smiling. 

"It  is  Mademoiselle  Sarah  Vedel,  the  sister  of  the  very  lady 
you  were  mentioning — my  friend  Madame  Douviers." 

In  default  of  any  better  repartee,  he  sharpened  the  words 
"my  friend"  like  an  arrow — but  an  arrow  which  fell  short,  and 
Passavant,  letting  it  lie,  went  on: 

"It  would  be  very  kind  of  you  to  introduce  me." 

He  had  said  these  last  words  and  the  sentence  which  pre- 
ceded them  loud  enough  for  Sarah  to  hear,  and  as  she  turned 
towards  them,  Edouard  was  unable  to  escape: 

"Sarah,  the  Comte  de  Passavant  desires  the  honour  of  your 
acquaintance,"  said  he  with  a  forced  smile. 

Passavant  had  sent  for  three  fresh  glasses,  which  he  filled  with 
kummel.  They  all  four  drank  Olivier's  health.  The  bottle  was 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  274 

almost  empty,  and  as  Sarah  was  astonished  to  see  the  crystals 
remaining  at  the  bottom,  Passavant  tried  to  dislodge  them  with 
a  straw.  A  strange  kind  of  clown,  with  a  befloured  face,  a  black 
beady  eye,  and  hair  plastered  down  on  his  head  like  a  skull- 
cap, came  up. 

"You  won't  do  it,"  he  said,  munching  out  each  one  of  his 
syllables  with  an  effort  which  was  obviously  assumed.  "Pass  me 
the  bottle.  I'll  smash  it." 

He  seized  it,  broke  it  with  a  blow  against  the  window  ledge, 
and  presenting  the  bottom  of  the  bottle  to  Sarah : 

"With  a  few  of  these  little  sharp-edged  polyhedra,  the  charm- 
ing young  lady  will  easily  induce  a  perforation  of  her  gizzard." 

"Who  is  that  pierrot?"  she  asked  Passavant,  who  had  made 
her  sit  down  and  was  sitting  beside  her. 

"It's  Alfred  Jarry,  the  author  of  Ubu  Rot.  The  Argonauts 
have  dubbed  him  a  genius  because  the  public  have  just  damned 
his  play.  All  the  same,  it's  the  most  interesting  thing  that's 
been  put  on  the  stage  for  a  long  time." 

"I  like  Vhu  Roi  very  much,"  said  Sarah,  "and  I'm  delighted 
to  see  Jarry.  I  had  heard  he  was  always  drunk." 

"I  should  think  he  must  be  to-night.  I  saw  him  drink  two 
glasses  of  neat  absinthe  at  dinner.  He  doesn't  seem  any  the 
worse  for  it.  Won't  you  have  a  cigarette?  One  has  to  smoke 
oneself  so  as  not  to  be  smothered  by  the  other  people's  smoke." 

He  bent  towards  her  to  give  her  a  light.  She  crunched  a  few 
of  the  crystals. 

"Why!  it's  nothing  but  sugar  candy,"  said  she,  a  little  disap- 
pointed. "I  hoped  it  was  going  to  be  something  strong." 

All  the  time  she  was  talking  to  Passavant,  she  kept  smiling 
at  Bernard,  who  had  stayed  beside  her.  Her  dancing  eyes  shone 
with  an  extraordinary  brightness.  Bernard,  who  had  not  been 
able  to  see  her  before  because  of  the  dark,  was  struck  by  her 
likeness  to  Laura.  The  same  forehead,  the  same  lips.  ...  In 
her  features,  it  is  true,  there  breathed  a  less  angelic  grace,  and 
her  looks  stirred  he  knew  not  what  troubled  depths  in  his  heart. 
Feeling  a  little  uncomfortable,  he  turned  to  Olivier: 


275  THE   ARGONAUTS'   DINNER 

"Introduce  me  to  your  friend  Bercail." 

He  had  already  met  Bercail  in  the  Luxembourg,  but  he  had 
never  spoken  to  him.  Bercail  was  feeling  rather  out  of  it  in 
this  milieu  into  which  Olivier  had  introduced  him,  and  which 
he  was  too  timid  not  to  find  distasteful,  and  every  time  Olivier 
presented  him  as  one  of  the  chief  contributors  to  the  Vanguard, 
he  blushed.  The  fact  is,  that  the  allegorical  poem  of  which 
he  had  spoken  to  Olivier  at  the  beginning  of  our  story,  was  to 
appear  on  the  first  page  of  the  new  review,  immediately  after 
the  manifesto. 

"In  the  place  I  had  kept  for  you,"  said  Olivier  to  Bernard. 
"I'm  sure  you'll  like  it.  It's  by  far  the  best  thing  in  the  number. 
And  so  original!" 

Olivier  took  more  pleasure  in  praising  his  friends  than  in 
hearing  himself  praised.  At  Bernard's  approach,  Bercail  rose; 
he  was  holding  his  cup  of  coffee  in  his  hand  so  awkwardly,  that 
in  his  agitation  he  spilled  half  of  it  down  his  waistcoat.  At  that 
moment,  Jarry's  mechanical  voice  was  heard  close  at  hand: 

"Little  Bercail  will  be  poisoned.  I've  put  poison  in  his  cup." 

Bercail's  timidity  amused  Jarry,  and  he  liked  putting  him  out 
of  countenance.  But  Bercail  was  not  afraid  of  Jarry.  He 
shrugged  his  shoulders  and  finished  his  coffee  calmly. 

"Who  is  that?"  asked  Bernard. 

"What !  Don't  you  know  the  author  of  Ubu  Roif" 

"Not  possible!  That  Jarry?  I  took  him  for  a  servant." 

"Oh,  all  the  same,"  said  Olivier,  a  little  ve.xed,  for  he  took  a 
pride  in  his  great  men.  "Look  at  him  more  carefully.  Don't  you 
think  he's  extraordinary?" 

"He  does  all  he  can  to  appear  so,"  said  Bernard,  who  only 
esteemed  what  was  natural,  and  who  nevertheless  was  full  of 
consideration  for  Uhu. 

Everything  about  Jarry,  who  was  got  up  to  look  like  the 
traditional  circus  clown,  smacked  of  affectation — his  way  of 
talking  in  particular;  several  of  the  Argonauts  did  their  ut- 
most to  imitate  it,  snapping  out  their  syllables,  inventing  odd 
words,  and  oddly  mangling  others;  but  it  was  only  Jarry  who 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  276 

could  succeed  in  producing  that  toneless  voice  of  his — a  voice 
without  warmth  or  intonation,  or  accent  or  emphasis. 

"When  one  knows  him,  he  is  charming,  really,"  went  on 
Olivier. 

"I  prefer  not  to  know  him.  He  looks  ferocious." 

"Oh,  that's  just  the  way  he  has.  Passavant  thinks  that  in 
reality  he  is  the  kindest  of  creatures.  But  he  has  drunk  a  ter- 
rible lot  to-night;  and  not  a  drop  of  water,  you  may  be  sure — 
nor  even  of  wine;  nothing  but  absinthe  and  spirits.  Passavant's 
afraid  he  may  do  something  eccentric." 

In  spite  of  himself,  Passavant's  name  kept  recurring  to  his 
lips,  and  all  the  more  obstinately  that  he  wanted  to  avoid  it. 

Exasperated  at  feeling  so  little  able  to  control  himself,  and 
as  if  he  were  trying  to  escape  from  his  own  pursuit,  he  changed 
his  ground: 

"You  should  talk  to  Dhurmer  a  little.  I'm  afraid  he  bears  me 
a  deadly  grudge  for  having  stepped  into  his  shoes  at  the  Van- 
guard; but  it  really  wasn't  my'  fault;  I  simply  had  to  accept. 
You  might  try  and  make  him  see  it  and  calm  him  down  a  bit. 
Pass  .  .  .  I'm  told  he's  fearfully  worked  up  against  me." 

He  had  tripped,  but  this  time  he  had  not  fallen. 

"I  hope  he  has  taken  his  copy  with  him.  1  don't  like  what 
he  writes,"  said  Bercail;  then  turning  to  Bernard:  "But,  you, 
Monsieur  Profitendieu,  I  thought  that  you  .  .  ." 

"Oh,  please  don't  call  me  Monsieur  ...  I  know  I've  got  a 
ridiculous  mouthful  of  a  name  ...  I  mean  to  take  a  pseu- 
donym, if  1  write." 

"Why  haven't  you  contributed  anything?" 

"Because  I  hadn't  anything  ready." 

Olivier,  leaving  his  two  friends  to  talk  together,  went  up  to 
Edouard. 

"How  nice  of  you  to  come!  I  was  longing  to  see  you  again. 
But  I  would  rather  have  met  you  anywhere  but  here.  ,  .  . 
This  afternoon,  I  went  and  rang  at  your  door.  Did  they  tell 
you?  I  was  so  sorry  not  to  find  you;  if  I  had  known  where  you 
were  .  .  ." 

He  was  quite  pleased  to  be  able  to  express  himself  so  easily, 


277  THE   ARGONAUTS'   DINNER 

remembering  a  time  when  his  emotion  in  Edouard's  presence 
kept  him  dumb.  This  ease  of  his  was  due,  alas!  to  his  potations 
and  to  the  banality  of  his  words. 

Edouard  realized  it  sadly. 

T  was  at  your  mother's."  (And  for  the  first  time  he  said 
"you"  to  Olivier  instead  of  "thou.") 

"Were  you?"  said  Olivier,  who  was  in  a  state  of  consterna- 
tion at  Edouard's  style  of  address.  He  hesitated  whether  he 
should  not  tell  him  so. 

"Is  it  in  this  milieu  that  you  mean  to  live  for  the  future?" 
asked  Edouard,  looking  at  him  fixedly. 

"Oh,  I  don't  let  it  encroach  on  me." 

"Are  you  quite  sure  of  that?" 

These  words  were  said  in  so  grave,  so  tender,  so  fraternal  a 
tone  .  .  .  Olivier  felt  his  self-assurance  tottering  within  him. 

"You  think  I  am  wrong  to  frequent  these  people?" 

"Not  all  of  them,  perhaps;  but  certainly  some." 

Olivier  took  this  as  a  direct  allusion  to  Passavant,  and  in  his 
inward  sky  a  flash  of  blinding,  painful  light  shot  through  the 
bank  of  clouds  which  ever  since  the  morning  had  been  thicken- 
ing and  darkening  in  his  heart.  He  loved  Bernard,  he  loved 
Edouard  far  too  well  to  bear  the  loss  of  their  esteem.  Edouard's 
presence  exalted  all  that  was  best  in  him;  Passavant's  all  that 
was  worst;  he  acknowledged  it  now;  and  indeed,  had  he  not 
always  known  it?  Had  not  his  blindness  as  regards  Passavant 
been  deliberate?  His  gratitude  for  all  that  the  count  had  done 
for  him  turned  to  loathing.  With  his  whole  soul,  he  cast  him 
off.  What  he  now  saw  put  the  finishing  touch  to  his  hatred. 

Passavant,  leaning  towards  Sarah,  had  passed  his  arm  round 
her  waist  and  was  becoming  more  and  more  pressing.  Aware 
of  the  unpleasant  rumours  which  were  rife  concerning  his  re- 
lations with  Olivier,  he  thought  he  would  give  them  the  lie. 
And  to  make  his  behaviour  more  public,  he  had  determined  to 
get  Sarah  to  sit  on  his  knees.  Sarah  had  so  far  put  up  very 
little  defence,  but  her  eyes  sought  Bernard's,  and  when  they 
met  them,  her  smile  seemed  to  say: 

"See  how  far  a  person  may  go  with  me!" 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  278 

But  Passavant  was  afraid  of  overdoing  it;  he  was  lacking  in 
experience. 

"If  I  can  only  get  her  to  drink  a  little  more,  I'll  risk  it,"  he 
said  to  himself,  putting  out  his  free  hand  towards  a  bottle  of 
curagao. 

Olivier,  who  was  watching  him,  was  beforehand  with  him; 
he  snatched  up  the  bottle,  simply  to  prevent  Passavant  from 
getting  it;  but  as  soon  as  he  took  hold  of  it,  it  seemed  to  him 
that  the  liqueur  would  restore  him  a  little  of  his  courage — the 
courage  he  felt  failing  within  him — the  courage  he  needed  to 
utter,  loud  enough  for  Edouard  to  hear,  the  complaint  that  was 
trembling  on  his  lips: 

"If  only  you  had  chosen  .  .  ." 

Olivier  filled  his  glass  and  emptied  it  at  a  draught.  Just  at 
that  moment,  he  heard  Jarry,  who  was  moving  about  from 
group  to  group,  say  in  a  half-whisper,  as  he  passed  behind 
Bercail : 

"And  now  we're  going  to  ki-kill  little  Bercail." 

Bercail  turned  round  sharply: 

"Just  say  that  again  out  loud." 

Jarry  had  already  moved  away.  He  waited  until  he  had  got 
round  the  table  and  then  repeated  in  a  falsetto  voice: 

"And  now  we're  going  to  ki-kill  little  Bercail";  then,  taking 
out  of  his  pocket  a  large  pistol,  with  which  the  Argonauts  had 
often  seen  him  playing  about,  he  raised  it  to  his  shoulder. 

Jarry  had  acquired  the  reputation  of  being  a  good  shot.  Pro- 
tests were  heard.  In  the  drunken  state  in  which  he  now  was, 
people  were  not  very  sure  that  he  would  confine  himself  to 
play-acting.  But  little  Bercail  was  determined  to  show  he  was 
not  afraid;  he  got  on  to  a  chair,  and  with  his  arms  folded  be- 
hind his  back,  took  up  a  Napoleonic  attitude.  He  was  just  a 
little  ridiculous  and  some  tittering  was  heard,  but  it  was  at  once 
drowned  by  applause. 

Passavant  said  to  Sarah  very  quickly: 

"It  may  end  unpleasantly.  He's  completely  drunk.  Get  under 
the  table." 

Des  Brousses  tried  to  catch  hold  of  Jarry,  but  he  shook 


279  THE  ARGONAUTS'   DINNER 

him  off  and  got  on  to  a  chair  in  his  turn  (Bernard  noticed  he 
was  wearing  patent  leather  pumps).  Standing  there  straight  op- 
posite Bercail,  he  stretched  out  his  arm  and  took  aim. 

"Put  the  light  out!  Put  the  light  out!"  cried  des  Brousses. 

Edouard,  who  was  still  standing  by  the  door,  turned  the 
switch. 

Sarah  had  risen  in  obedience  to  Passavant's  injunction;  and 
as  soon  as  it  was  dark,  she  pressed  up  against  Bernard,  to  pull 
him  under  the  table  with  her. 

The  shot  went  off.  The  pistol  was  only  loaded  with  a  blank 
cartridge.  But  a  cry  of  pain  was  heard.  It  came  from  Justinien, 
who  had  been  hit  in  the  eye  by  the  wad. 

And,  when  the  light  was  turned  on  again,  there,  to  every- 
one's admiration,  stood  Bercail,  still  on  his  chair  in  the  same 
attitude,  motionless  and  barely  a  shade  paler. 

In  the  mean  time  the  President's  lady  was  indulging  in  a  fit 
of  hysterics.  Her  friends  crowded  round  her. 

"Idiotic  to  give  people  such  a  turn." 

As  there  was  no  water  on  the  table,  Jarry,  who  had  climbed 
down  from  his  pedestal,  dipped  a  handkerchief  in  brandy  to 
rub  her  temples  with,  by  way  of  apology. 

Bernard  had  stayed  only  a  second  under  the  table,  just  long 
enough  to  feel  Sarah's  two  burning  lips  crushed  voluptuously 
against  his.  Olivier  had  followed  them;  out  of  friendship,  out 
of  jealousy.  .  .  .  That  horrible  feeling  which  he  knew  so  well, 
of  being  out  of  it,  was  exacerbated  by  his  being  drunk.  When, 
in  his  turn,  he  came  out  from  underneath  the  table,  his  head 
was  swimming.  He  heard  Dhurmer  exclaim: 

"Look  at  Molinier!  He's  as  funky  as  a  girl!" 

It  was  too  much.  Olivier,  hardly  knowing  what  he  was  doing, 
darted  towards  Dhurmer  with  his  hand  raised.  He  seemed  to 
be  moving  in  a  dream.  Dhurmer  dodged  the  blow.  As  in  a 
dream,  Olivier's  hand  met  nothing  but  empty  air. 

The  confusion  became  general,  and  while  some  of  the  guests 
were  fussing  over  the  President's  lady,  who  was  still  gesticulat- 
ing wildly  and  uttering  shrill  little  yelps  as  she  did  so,  others 
crowded  round  Dhurmer,  who  called  out:  "He  didn't  touch 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  280 

me!  He  didn't  touch  me!"  .  .  .  and  others  round  Olivier,  who, 
with  a  scarlet  face,  wanted  to  rush  at  him  again,  and  was  with 
great  difficulty  restrained. 

Touched  or  not,  Dhurmer  must  consider  that  he  had  had  his 
ears  boxed;  so  Justinien,  as  he  dabbed  his  eye,  endeavoured  to 
make  him  understand.  It  was  a  question  of  dignity.  But  Dhur- 
mer was  not  in  the  least  inclined  to  receive  lessons  in  dignity 
from  Justinien.  He  kept  on  repeating  obstinately: 

"Didn't  touch  me!  .  .  .  Didn't  touch  me!" 

"Can't  you  leave  him  alone?"  said  des  Brousses.  "One  can't 
force  a  fellow  to  fight  if  he  doesn't  want  to." 

Olivier,  however,  declared  in  a  loud  voice,  that  if  Dhurmer 
wasn't  satisfied,  he  was  ready  to  box  his  ears  again;  and,  de- 
termined to  force  a  duel,  asked  Bernard  and  Bercail  to  be 
his  seconds.  Neither  of  them  knew  anything  about  so-called 
"affairs  of  honour";  but  Olivier  didn't  dare  apply  to  Edouard. 
His  neck-tie  had  come  undone;  his  hair  had  fallen  over  his  fore- 
head, which  was  dank  with  sweat;  his  hands  trembled  convul- 
sively. 

Edouard  took  him  by  the  arm: 

"Come  and  bathe  your  face  a  little.  You  look  like  a  lunatic." 

He  led  him  away  to  a  lavatory. 

As  soon  as  he  was  out  of  the  room,  Olivier  understood  how 
drunk  he  was.  When  he  had  felt  Edouard's  hand  laid  upon 
his  arm,  he  thought  he  was  going  to  faint,  and  let  himself  be 
led  away  unresisting.  Of  all  that  Edouard  had  said  to  him,  he 
only  understood  that  he  had  called  him  "thou."  As  a  storm- 
cloud  bursts  into  rain,  he  felt  his  heart  suddenly  dissolve  in 
tears.  A  damp  towel  which  Edouard  put  to  his  forehead  brought 
him  finally  to  his  sober  senses  again.  What  had  happened?  He 
was  vaguely  conscious  of  having  behaved  like  a  child,  like  a 
brute.  He  felt  himself  ridiculous,  abject.  .  .  .  Then,  quiver- 
ing with  distress  and  tenderness,  he  flung  himself  towards 
Edouard,  pressed  up  against  him  and  sobbed  out: 

"Take  me  away!" 

Edouard  was  extremely  moved  himself: 

"Your  parents?"  he  asked. 


281  THE  ARGONAUTS'   DINNER 

"They  don't  know  I'm  back." 

As  they  were  going  through  the  cafe  downstairs  on  the  way 
out,  Olivier  said  to  his  companion  that  he  had  a  line  to  write. 
"If  I  post  it  to-night  it'll  get  there  to-morrow  morning." 
Seated  at  a  table  in  the  cafe  he  wrote  as  follows : 

My  dear  George, 

Yes,  this  letter  is  from  me,  and  it's  to  ask  you  to  do  some- 
thing for  me.  I  don't  suppose  it's  news  to  you  to  hear  I  am 
back  in  Paris,  for  I  think  you  saw  me  this  morning  near  the 
Sorbonne.  I  was  staying  with  the  Comte  de  Passavant  (Rue  de 
Babylone) ;  my  things  are  still  there.  For  reasons  it  would  be 
too  long  to  explain  and  which  wouldn't  interest  you,  I  prefer 
not  to  go  back  to  him.  You  are  the  only  person  I  can  ask  to  go 
and  fetch  them  away — my  things,  I  mean.  You'll  do  this  for 
me,  won't  you?  I'll  remember  it  when  it's  your  turn.  There's 
a  locked  trunk.  As  for  the  things  in  the  room,  put  them  yourself 
into  my  suit-case,  and  bring  the  lot  to  Uncle  Edouard's.  I'll 
pay  for  the  taxi.  To-morrow's  Sunday  fortunately;  you'll  be 
able  to  do  it  as  soon  as  you  get  this  line.  I  can  count  upon  you, 
can't  I? 

Your  affectionate  brother 

Olivier 

P.S. — I  know  you're  sharp  enough  and  you'll  be  able  to  man- 
age all  right.  But  mind,  that  if  you  have  any  direct  dealings 
with  Passavant,  you  are  to  be  very  distant  with  him. 

Those  who  had  not  heard  Dhurmer's  insulting  words  could 
not  understand  the  reason  of  Olivier's  sudden  assault.  He 
seemed  to  have  lost  his  head.  If  he  had  kept  cool,  Bernard  would 
have  approved  him;  he  didn't  like  Dhurmer;  but  he  had  to 
admit  that  Olivier  had  behaved  like  a  madman  and  put  him- 
self entirely  in  the  wrong.  It  pained  Bernard  to  hear  him  judged 
severely.  He  went  up  to  Bercail  and  made  an  appointment  with 
him.  However  absurd  the  affair  was,  they  were  both  anxious 
to  conduct  it  correctly.  They  agreed  to  go  and  call  on  their 
client  at  nine  o'clock  the  next  morning. 

When  his  two  friends  had  gone,  Bernard  had  neither  reason 
nor  inclination  to  stay.  He  looked  round  the  room  in  search  of 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  282 

Sarah  and  his  heart  swelled  with  a  kind  of  rage  to  see  her 
sitting  on  Passavant's  knee.  They  both  seemed  drunk;  Sarah, 
however,  rose  when  she  saw  Bernard  coming  up. 

"Let's  go,"  she  said,  taking  his  arm. 

She  wanted  to  walk  home.  It  was  not  far.  They  spoke  not 
a  word  on  the  way.  At  the  pension  all  the  lights  were  out.  Fear- 
ful of  attracting  attention,  they  groped  their  way  to  the  back- 
stairs, and  there  struck  matches.  Armand  was  waiting  for  them. 
When  he  heard  them  coming  upstairs,  he  went  out  on  to  the 
landing  with  a  lamp  in  his  hand. 

"Take  the  lamp,"  said  he  to  Bernard.  "Light  Sarah;  there's 
no  candle  in  her  room  .  .  .  and  give  me  your  matches  so  that 
I  can  light  mine."  Bernard  accompanied  Sarah  into  the  inner 
room.  They  were  no  sooner  inside  than  Armand,  leaning  over 
from  behind  them,  blew  the  lamp  out  at  a  single  breath,  then, 
with  a  chuckle: 

"Good-night!"  said  he.  "But  don't  make  a  row.  The  parents 
are  sleeping  next  door." 

Then,  suddenly  stepping  back,  he  shut  the  door  on  them; 
and  bolted  it. 


IX 

OLIVIER  AND    EDOUARD 

Armand  has  lain  down  in  his  clothes.  He  knows  he  will  not 
be  able  to  sleep.  He  waits  for  the  night  to  come  to  an  end.  He 
meditates.  He  listens.  The  house  is  resting,  the  town,  the  whole 
of  nature;  not  a  sound. 

As  soon  as  a  faint  light,  cast  down  by  the  reflector  from 
the  narrow  strip  of  sky  above,  enables  him  to  distinguish 
once  more  the  hideous  squalor  of  his  room,  he  rises.  He  goes 
towards  the  door  which  he  bolted  the  night  before;  opens  it 
gently.  .  .  . 

The  curtains  of  Sarah's  room  are  not  drawn.  The  rising  dawn 
whitens  the  window  pane.  Armand  goes  up  to  the  bed  where  his 
sister  and  Bernard  are  resting.  A  sheet  half  hides  them  as  they 
lie  with  limbs  entwined.  How  beautiful  they  are!  Armand  gazes 
at  them  and  gazes.  He  would  like  to  be  their  sleep,  their  kisses. 
At  first  he  smiles,  then,  at  the  foot  of  the  bed,  among  the 
coverings  they  have  flung  aside,  he  suddenly  kneels  down.  To 
what  god  can  he  be  praying  thus  with  folded  hands?  An  un- 
speakable emotion  shakes  him.  His  lips  are  trembling  ...  he 
rises.  .  .  . 

But  on  the  threshold  of  the  door,  he  turns.  He  wants  to  wake 
Bernard  so  that  he  may  gain  his  own  room  before  anyone  in 
the  house  is  awake.  At  the  slight  noise  Armand  makes,  Bernard 
opens  his  eyes.  Armand  hurries  away,  leaving  the  door  open.  He 
leaves  his  room,  goes  downstairs;  he  will  hide  no  matter  where; 
his  presence  would  embarrass  Bernard;  he  does  not  want  to  meet 
him. 

From  a  window  in  the  class-room  a  few  minutes  later,  he  sees 
him  go  by,  skirting  the  walls  like  a  thief.  .  .  . 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  284 

Bernard  has  not  slept  much.  But  that  night  he  has  tasted  a 
forgetfulness  more  restful  than  sleep — the  exaltation  at  once 
and  the  annihilation  of  self.  Strange  to  himself,  ethereal,  buoy- 
ant, calm  and  tense  as  a  god,  he  glides  into  another  day.  He  has 
left  Sarah  still  asleep— disengaged  himself  furtively  from  her 
arms.  What!  without  one  more  kiss?  without  a  last  lover's 
look?  without  a  supreme  embrace?  Is  it  through  insensibility 
that  he  leaves  her  in  this  way?  I  cannot  tell.  He  cannot  tell 
himself.  He  tries  not  to  think;  it  is  a  difficult  task  to  incorporate 
this  unprecedented  night  with  all  the  preceding  nights  of  his 
history.  No;  it  is  an  appendix,  an  annex,  which  can  find  no 
place  in  the  body  of  the  book — a  book  where  the  story  of  his 
life  will  continue,  surely,  will  take  up  the  thread  again,  as  if 
nothing  had  happened. 

He  goes  upstairs  to  the  room  he  shares  with  little  Boris.  What 
a  child!  He  is  fast  asleep.  Bernard  undoes  his  bed,  rumples  the 
bed-clothes,  so  as  to  give  it  the  look  of  having  been  slept  in. 
He  sluices  himself  with  water.  But  the  sight  of  Boris  takes  him 
back  to  Saas-Fee.  He  recalls  what  Laura  once  said  to  him  there: 
"I  can  only  accept  from  you  the  devotion  which  you  offer  me. 
The  rest  will  have  its  exigences  and  will  have  to  be  satisfied  else- 
where." This  sentence  had  revolted  him.  He  seems  to  hear  it 
again.  He  had  ceased  to  think  of  it,  but  this  morning  his  mem- 
ory is  extraordinarily  active.  His  mind  works  in  spite  of 
himself  with  marvellous  alacrity.  Bernard  thrusts  aside  Laura's 
image,  tries  to  smother  these  recollections;  and,  to  prevent  him- 
self from  thinking,  he  seizes  a  lesson  book  and  forces  himself  to 
read  for  his  examination.  But  the  room  is  stifling.  He  goes  down 
to  work  in  the  garden.  He  would  like  to  go  out  into  the  street, 
walk,  run,  get  into  the  open,  breathe  the  fresh  air.  He  watches 
tlie  street  door;  as  soon  as  the  porter  opens  it,  he  makes  off. 

He  reaches  the  Luxembourg  with  his  book,  and  sits  down  on 
a  bench.  He  spins  his  thoughts  like  silk;  but  how  fragile!  If  he 
pulls  it,  the  thread  breaks.  As  soon  as  he  tries  to  work,  indiscreet 
memories  wander  obtrusively  between  his  book  and  him;  and 
not  the  memories  of  the  keenest  moments  of  his  joy,  but  ridicu- 


285  OLIVIER  AND  EDOUARD 

lous,  trifling  little  details — so  many  thorns,  which  catch  and 
scratch  and  mortify  his  vanity.  Another  time  he  will  show  him- 
self less  of  a  novice. 

About  nine  o'clock,  he  gets  up  to  go  and  fetch  Lucien  Ber- 
cail.  Together  they  make  their  way  to  Edouard's. 

Edouard  lived  at  Passy  on  the  top  floor  of  an  apartment 
house.  His  room  opened  on  to  a  vast  studio.  When,  in  the  early 
dawn,  Olivier  had  risen,  Edouard  at  first  had  felt  no  anxiety. 

"I'm  going  to  lie  down  a  little  on  the  sofa,"  Olivier  had 
said.  And  as  Edouard  was  afraid  he  might  catch  cold,  he  had 
told  Olivier  to  take  some  blankets  with  him.  A  little  later,  Ed- 
ouard in  his  turn  had  risen.  He  had  certainly  been  asleep  with- 
out being  aware  of  it,  for  he  was  astonished  to  find  that  it  was 
now  broad  daylight.  He  wanted  to  see  whether  Olivier  was 
comfortable;  he  wanted  to  see  him  again;  and  perhaps  an  ob- 
scure presentiment  guided  him.  .  .  . 

The  studio  was  empty.  The  blankets  were  lying  at  the  foot 
of  the  couch  unfolded.  A  horrible  smell  of  gas  gave  him  the 
alarm.  Opening  out  of  the  studio,  there  was  a  little  room  which 
served  as  a  bath-room.  The  smell  no  doubt  came  from  there. 
He  ran  to  the  door;  but  at  first  was  unable  to  push  it  open; 
there  was  some  obstacle — it  was  Olivier's  body,  sunk  in  a  heap 
beside  the  bath,  undressed,  icy,  livid  and  horribly  soiled  with 
vomiting. 

Edouard  turned  ofi"  the  gas  which  was  coming  from  the  jet. 
What  had  happened?  An  accident?  A  stroke?  ...  He  could 
not  believe  it.  The  bath  was  empty.  He  took  the  dying  boy  in 
his  arms,  carried  him  into  the  studio,  laid  him  on  the  carpet, 
in  front  of  the  wide  open  window.  On  his  knees,  stooping  ten- 
derly, he  put  his  ear  to  his  chest.  Olivier  was  still  breathing, 
but  faintly.  Then  Edouard,  desperately,  set  all  his  ingenuity 
to  work  to  rekindle  the  little  spark  of  life  so  near  extinction; 
he  moved  the  limp  arms  rhythmically  up  and  down,  pressed 
the  flanks,  rubbed  the  thorax,  tried  everything  he  had  heard 
should  be  done  in  a  case  of  suffocation,  in  despair  that  he  could 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  286 

not  do  everything  at  once.  Olivier's  eyes  remained  shut.  Ed- 
ouard  raised  his  eyelids  with  his  fingers,  but  they  dropped  at 
once  over  lifeless  eyes.  But  yet  his  heart  was  beating.  He 
searched  in  vain  for  brandy,  for  smelling  salts.  He  heated  some 
water,  washed  the  upper  part  of  the  body  and  the  face.  Then 
he  laid  this  inanimate  body  on  the  couch  and  covered  it 
with  blankets.  He  wanted  to  send  for  a  doctor,  but  was  afraid 
to  absent  himself.  A  charwoman  was  in  the  habit  of  coming 
every  morning  to  do  the  house-work;  but  not  before  nine 
o'clock.  As  soon  as  he  heard  her,  he  sent  her  off  at  once  to  fetch 
the  nearest  doctor;  then  he  called  her  back,  fearing  he  might 
be  exposed  to  an  enquiry. 

Olivier,  in  the  mean  time,  was  slowly  coming  back  to  life. 
Edouard  sat  beside  his  couch.  He  gazed  at  the  shut  book  of 
his  face,  baffled  by  its  riddle.  Why?  Why?  One  may  act  thought- 
lessly at  night  in  the  heat  of  intoxication,  but  the  resolutions  of 
early  morning  carry  with  them  their  full  weight  of  virtue.  He 
gave  up  trying  to  understand,  until  at  last  the  moment  should 
come  when  Olivier  would  be  able  to  speak.  Until  that  moment 
came  he  would  not  leave  him.  He  had  taken  one  of  his  hands 
in  his  and  concentrated  his  interrogation,  his  thoughts,  his 
whole  life  into  that  contact.  At  last  it  seemed  to  him  that  he 
felt  Olivier's  hand  responding  feebly  to  his  clasp.  .  .  .  Then  he 
bent  down,  and  set  his  lips  on  the  forehead,  where  an  immense 
and  mysterious  suffering  had  drawn  its  lines. 

A  ring  was  heard  at  the  door.  Edouard  rose  to  open  it.  It 
was  Bernard  and  Lucien  Bercail.  Edouard  kept  them  in  the  hall 
and  told  them  what  had  happened;  then,  taking  Bernard  aside, 
he  asked  if  he  knew  whether  Olivier  was  subject  to  attacks  of 
giddiness,  to  fits  of  any  kind?  .  .  .  Bernard  suddenly  remem- 
bered their  conversation  of  the  day  before,  and,  in  particular, 
some  words  of  Olivier's  which  he  had  hardly  listened  to  at  the 
time,  but  which  came  back  to  him  now,  as  distinctly  as  if  he 
heard  them  over  again. 

"It  was  I  who  began  to  speak  of  suicide,"  said  he  to  Edouard. 
"I  asked  him  if  he  understood  a  person's  killing  himself  out 
of  mere  excess  of  life,  'out  of  enthusiasm,'  as  Dmitri  Karamazof 


287  OLIVIER  AND   EDOUARD 

says.  I  was  absorbed  in  my  thought  and  at  the  time  I  paid  no 
attention  to  anything  but  my  own  words;  but  I  remember  now 
what  he  answered." 

"What  did  he  answer?"  insisted  Edouard,  for  Bernard  stopped 
as  though  he  were  reluctant  to  say  anything  more. 

"That  he  understood  killing  oneself,  but  only  after  having 
reached  such  heights  of  joy,  that  anything  afterwards  must  be 
a  descent." 

They  both  looked  at  each  other  and  added  nothing  further. 
Light  was  beginning  to  dawn  on  them.  Edouard  at  last  turned 
away  his  eyes;  and  Bernard  was  angry  with  himself  for  having 
spoken.  They  went  up  to  Bercail. 

"The  tiresome  thing  is,"  said  he,  "that  people  may  think  he 
has  tried  to  kill  himself  in  order  to  avoid  fighting." 

Edouard  had  forgotten  all  about  the  duel. 

"Behave  as  if  nothing  had  happened,"  said  he.  "Go  and 
find  Dhurmer,  and  ask  him  to  tell  you  who  his  seconds  are.  It 
is  to  them  thati  you  must  explain  matters,  if  the  idiotic 
business  doesn't  settle  itself.  Dhurmer  didn't  seem  particularly 
keen." 

"We  will  tell  him  nothing,"  said  Lucien,  "and  leave  him  all 
the  shame  of  retreating.  For  he  will  shuffle  out  of  it,  I'm  cer- 
tain." 

Bernard  asked  if  he  might  see  Olivier.  But  Edouard  thought 
he  had  better  be  kept  quiet. 

Bernard  and  Lucien  were  just  leaving,  when  young  George 
arrived.  He  came  from  Passavant's,  but  had  not  been  able  to 
get  hold  of  his  brother's  things. 

"Monsieur  le  Comte  is  not  at  home,"  he  had  been  told.  "He 
has  left  no  orders." 

And  the  servant  had  shut  the  door  in  his  face. 

A  certain  gravity  in  Edouard's  tone,  in  the  bearing  of  the 
two  others,  alarmed  George.  He  scented  something  out  of  the 
way — made  enquiries.  Edouard  was  obliged  to  tell  him. 

"But  say  nothing  about  it  to  your  parents." 

George  was  delighted  to  be  let  into  a  secret. 

"A  fellow  can  hold  his  tongue,"  said  he.  And  as  he  had 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  288 

nothing  to  do  that  morning,  he  proposed  to  accompany  Bernard 
and  Lucien  on  their  way  to  Dhurmer's, 

After  his  three  visitors  had  left  him,  Edouard  called  the  char- 
woman. Next  to  his  own  room  was  a  spare  room,  which  he  told 
her  to  get  ready,  so  that  Olivier  might  be  put  into  it.  Then  he 
went  noiselessly  back  to  the  studio.  Olivier  was  resting.  Edouard 
sat  down  again  beside  him.  He  had  taken  a  book,  but  he  soon 
threw  it  aside  without  having  opened  it,  and  watched  his  friend 
sleeping. 


X 

OLIVIER'S  CONVALESCENCE 

Rien  n  est  simple  de  ce  qui  s'ofjre  a  I'dme; 
et  I'dme  ne  s'offre  jamais  simple  a  aucun  sujet. 

Pascal 

"I  THINK  he  will  be  glad  to  see  you,"  said  Edouard  to  Bernard 
next  morning.  "He  asked  me  this  morning  if  you  hadn't  come 
yesterday.  He  must  have  heard  your  voice,  at  the  time  when  I 
thought  he  was  unconscious.  ...  He  keeps  his  eyes  shut,  but  he 
doesn't  sleep.  He  doesn't  speak.  He  often  puts  his  hand  to  his 
forehead,  as  if  it  were  aching.  Whenever  I  speak  to  him  he 
frowns;  but  if  I  go  away,  he  calls  me  back  and  makes  me  sit 
beside  him.  .  .  .  No,  he  isn't  in  the  studio.  I  have  put  him  in 
the  spare  room  next  to  mine,  so  that  I  can  receive  visitors  with- 
out disturbing  him." 

They  went  into  it. 

"I've  come  to  enquire  after  you,"  said  Bernard  very  softly. 

Olivier's  features  brightened  at  the  sound  of  his  friend's 
voice.  It  was  almost  a  smile  already. 

"I  was  expecting  you." 

"I'll  go  away  if  I  tire  you." 

"Stay." 

But  as  he  said  the  word,  Olivier  put  his  finger  on  his  lips.  He 
didn't  want  to  be  spoken  to.  Bernard,  who  was  going  up  for  his 
viva  voce  in  three  days'  time,  never  moved  without  carrying  in 
his  pocket  one  of  those  manuals  which  contain  a  concentrated 
elixir  of  the  bitter  stuff  which  is  the  subject  matter  of  examina- 
tions. He  sat  down  beside  his  bed  and  plunged  into  his  reading. 
Olivier,  his  face  turned  to  the  wall,  seemed  to  be  asleep. 
Edouard  had  gone  to  his  own  room,  which  communicated  with 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  290 

Olivier's;  the  door  between  them  had  been  left  open,  and  from 
time  to  time  he  appeared  at  it.  Every  two  hours  he  made  Oli- 
vier drink  a  glass  of  milk,  but  only  since  that  morning.  During 
the  whole  of  the  preceding  day,  the  patient  had  been  unable  to 
take  any  food. 

A  long  time  went  by.  Bernard  rose  to  go.  Olivier  turned  round, 
held  out  his  hand,  and  with  an  attempt  at  a  smile: 

"You'll  come  back  to-morrow?" 

At  the  last  moment  he  called  him  back,  signed  to  him  to  stoop 
down,  as  if  he  were  afraid  of  not  making  himself  heard,  and 
whispered: 

"Did  you  ever  know  such  an  idiot?" 

Then,  as  though  to  forestall  Bernard's  protest,  put  his  finger 
again  to  his  lips. 

"No,  no;  I'll  explain  later." 

The  next  morning  Edouard  received  a  letter  from  Laura, 
when  Bernard  came,  he  gave  it  to  him  to  read: 

My  dear  friend, 

I  am  writing  to  you  in  a  great  hurry  to  try  and  prevent  an 
absurd  disaster.  You  will  help  me,  I  am  sure,  if  only  this  letter 
reaches  you  in  time. 

Felix  has  just  left  for  Paris,  with  the  intention  of  going  to 
see  you.  His  idea  is  to  get  from  you  the  explanation  which  I 
refuse  to  give  him;  he  wants  you  to  tell  him  the  name  of  the 
person,  whom  he  wishes  to  challenge.  I  have  done  all  I  can  to 
stop  him,  but  nothing  has  any  effect  and  all  1  say  merely  serves 
to  make  him  more  determined.  You  are  the  only  person  who  will 
perhaps  be  able  to  dissuade  him.  He  has  confidence  in  you  and 
will,  1  hope,  listen  to  you.  Remember  that  he  has  never  in  his 
life  held  a  pistol  or  a  foil  in  his  hands.  The  idea  that  he  may  risk 
his  life  for  my  sake  is  intolerable  to  me;  but — I  hardly  dare 
own  it — I  am  really  more  afraid  of  his  covering  himself  with 
ridicule. 

Since  I  got  back,  Felix  has  been  all  that  is  attentive  and 
tender  and  kind;  but  I  cannot  bring  myself  to  show  more  love 
for  him  than  I  feel.  He  suff'ers  from  this;  and  I  believe  it  is  his 


291  OLIVIER'S  CONVALESCENCE 

desire  to  force  my  esteem,  my  admiration,  that  is  making  him 
take  this  step,  which  will  no  doubt  appear  to  you  unconsidered, 
but  of  which  he  thinks  day  and  night,  and  which,  since  my 
return,  has  become  an  idee  fixe  with  him.  He  has  certainly  for- 
given me;  but  he  bears  ...  a  mortal  grudge. 

Please,  I  beg  of  you,  welcome  him  as  affectionately  as  you 
would  welcome  myself;  no  proof  of  your  friendship  could  touch 
me  more.  Forgive  me  for  not  having  written  to  you  sooner  to 
tell  you  once  more  how  grateful  I  am  for  all  the  care  and  kind- 
ness you  lavished  on  me  during  our  stay  in  Switzerland.  The 
recollection  of  that  time  keeps  me  warm  and  helps  me  to  bear 
my  life. 

Your  ever  anxious  and  ever  confident  friend 

Laura 


"What  do  you  mean  to  do?"  asked  Bernard,  as  he  gave  the 
letter  back. 

"What  can  I  do?"  replied  Edouard,  slightly  irritated,  not  so 
much  by  Bernard's  question,  as  by  the  fact  that  he  had  already 
put  it  to  himself.  "If  he  comes,  I  will  receive  him  to  the  best  of 
my  abilities.  If  he  asks  my  advice,  I  will  give  him  the  best  I  can; 
and  try  to  persuade  him  that  the  most  sensible  thing  he  can  do  is 
to  keep  quiet.  People  like  poor  Douviers  are  always  wrong  to 
put  themselves  forward.  You'd  think  the  same  if  you  knew  him, 
believe  me.  Laura,  on  the  other  hand,  was  cut  out  for  a  leading 
role.  Each  of  us  assumes  the  drama  that  suits  his  measure,  and 
is  allotted  his  share  of  tragedy.  What  can  we  do  about  it? 
Laura's  drama  is  to  have  married  a  super.  There's  no  help  for 
that." 

"And  Douviers'  drama  is  to  have  married  someone  who  will 
always  be  his  superior,  do  what  he  may,"  rejoined  Bernard. 

"Do  what  he  may  .  .  ."  echoed  Edouard,  " — and  do  what 
Laura  may.  The  admirable  thing  is  that  Laura,  out  of  regret 
for  her  fault,  out  of  repentance,  wanted  to  humble  herself  be- 
fore him;  but  he  immediately  prostrated  himself  lower  still; 
so  that  all  that  each  of  them  did  merely  served  to  make  hbn 
smaller  and  her  greater." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  292 

"I  pity  him  very  much,"  said  Bernard.  "But  why  won't  you 
allow  that  he  too  may  become  greater  by  prostrating  himself?" 

"Because  he  lacks  the  lyrical  spirit,"  said  Edouard  irrefuta- 
bly. 

"What  do  you  mean?" 

"He  never  forgets  himself  in  what  he  feels,  so  that  he  never 
feels  anything  great.  Don't  push  me  too  hard.  I  have  my  own 
ideas;  but  they  don't  lend  themselves  to  the  yard  measure, 
and  I  don't  care  to  measure  them.  Paul-Ambroise  is  in  the  habit 
of  saying  that  he  refuses  to  take  count  of  anything  that  can't 
be  put  down  in  figures;  I  think  he  is  playing  on  the  words  'take 
count';  for  if  that  were  the  case,  we  should  be  obliged  to  leave 
God  out  of  'the  account.'  That  of  course  is  where  he  is  tending 
and  what  he  desires.  .  .  .  Well,  for  instance,  I  think  I  call  lyri- 
cal the  state  of  the  man  who  consents  to  be  vanquished  by  God." 

"Isn't  that  exactly  what  the  word  enthusiasm  means?" 

"And  perhaps  the  word  inspiration.  Yes,  that  is  just  what  I 
mean:  Douviers  is  a  being  who  is  incapable  of  inspiration.  1 
admit  that  Paul-Ambroise  is  right  when  he  considers  inspira- 
tion as  one  of  the  most  harmful  things  in  art;  and  I  am  will- 
ing to  believe  that  one  can  only  be  an  artist  on  condition  of  mas- 
tering the  lyrical  state;  but  in  order  to  master  it,  one  must  first 
of  all  experience  it." 

"Don't  you  think  that  this  state  of  divine  visitation  can  be 
physiologically  explained  by  .  .  ." 

"Much  good  that  will  do!"  interrupted  Edouard.  "Such 
considerations  as  that,  even  if  they  are  true,  only  embarrass  fools. 
No  doubt  there  is  no  mystical  movement  that  has  not  its  corre- 
sponding material  manifestation.  What  then?  Mind,  in  order  to 
bear  its  witness,  cannot  do  without  matter.  Hence  the  mystery  of 
the  incarnation." 

"On  the  other  hand,  matter  does  admirably  without  mind." 

"Oh,  ho!  we  don't  know  about  that!"  said  Edouard,  laughing. 

Bernard  was  very  much  amused  to  hear  him  talk  in  this  way. 
As  a  rule  Edouard  was  more  reserved.  The  mood  he  was  in  to- 
day came  from  Olivier's  presence.  Bernard  understood  it. 

"He  is  talking  to  me  as  he  would  like  already  to  be  talking 


293  OLIVIER'S  CONVALESCENCE 

to  him,"  thought  he.  "It  is  Olivier  who  ought  to  be  his  secre- 
tary. As  soon  as  Olivier  is  well  again,  I  shall  retire.  My  place  is 
not  here." 

He  thought  this  without  bitterness,  entirely  taken  up  as  he 
now  was  by  Sarah,  with  whom  he  had  spent  the  preceding  night 
and  whom  he  was  to  see  that  night  too. 

"We've  left  Douviers  a  long  way  behind,"  he  said,  laughing  in 
his  turn.  "Will  you  tell  him  about  Vincent?" 

"Goodness  no!  What  for?" 

"Don't  you  think  it's  poisoning  Douviers'  life  not  to  know 
whom  to  suspect?" 

"Perhaps  you  are  right.  But  you  must  say  that  to  Laura.  I 
couldn't  tell  him  without  betraying  her.  .  .  .  Besides  I  don't 
even  know  where  he  is." 

"Vincent?  .  .  ,  Passavant  must  know." 

A  ring  at  the  door  interrupted  them.  Madame  MoHnier  had 
come  to  enquire  for  her  son.  Edouard  joined  her  in  the  studio. 


EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:  PAULINE 

Visit  from  Pauline.  I  was  a  little  puzzled  how  to  let  her  know, 
and  yet  1  could  not  keep  her  in  ignorance  of  her  son's  illness. 
I  thought  it  useless  to  say  anything  about  the  incomprehensible 
attempt  at  suicide  and  spoke  simply  of  a  violent  liver  attack, 
which,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  remains  the  clearest  result  of  the  pro- 
ceedings. 

"I  am  reassured  already  by  knowing  Olivier  is  with  you," 
said  Pauline.  "I  shouldn't  nurse  him  better  myself,  for  I  feel  that 
you  love  him  as  much  as  1  do." 

As  she  said  these  last  words,  she  looked  at  me  with  an  odd 
insistence.  Did  I  imagine  the  meaning  she  seemed  to  put  in  her 
look?  I  was  feeling  what  one  is  accustomed  to  call  "a  bad  con- 
science" as  regards  Pauline,  and  was  only  able  to  stammer  out 
something  incoherent.  I  must  also  say  that,  sur-saturated  as  I 
have  been  with  emotion  for  the  last  two  days,  1  had  entirely 
lost  command  of  myself;  my  confusion  must  have  been  very 
apparent,  for  she  added: 

"Your  blush  is  eloquent!  .  .  .  My  poor  dear  friend,  don't 
expect  reproaches  from  me.  I  should  reproach  you  if  you  didn't 
love  him.  .  .  .  Can  I  see  him?" 

I  took  her  in  to  Olivier.  Bernard  had  left  the  room  as  he 
heard  us  coming. 

"How  beautiful  he  is!"  she  murmured,  bending  over  the  bed. 
Then,  turning  towards  me:  "You  will  kiss  him  from  me.  I  am 
afraid  of  waking  him." 

Pauline  is  decidedly  an  extraordinary  woman.  And  to-day  is 
not  the  first  time  that  I  have  begun  to  think  so.  But  I  could 
not  have  hoped  that  she  would  push  comprehension  so  far.  And 
yet  it  seemed  to  me  that  behind  the  cordiality  of  her  words  and 


295  PAULINE 

the  pleasantness  she  put  into  her  voice,  I  could  distinguish  a 
touch  of  constraint  (perhaps  because  of  the  effort  I  myself 
made  to  hide  my  embarrassment) ;  and  I  remembered  a  sentence 
of  our  last  conversation — a  sentence  which  seemed  to  me  full 
of  wisdom  even  then,  when  I  was  not  interested  in  finding  it 
so:  "]  prefer  granting  with  a  good  grace  what  I  know  I  shan't 
be  able  to  prevent."  Evidently  Pauline  was  striving  after  good 
grace;  and,  as  if  in  response  to  my  secret  thoughts,  she  went 
on  again,  as  soon  as  we  were  back  in  the  studio: 

"By  not  being  shocked  just  now,  I  am  afraid  it  is  I  who  have 
shocked  you.  There  are  certain  liberties  of  thought  of  which  men 
would  like  to  keep  the  monopoly.  And  yet  I  can't  pretend  to  have 
more  reprobation  for  you  than  I  feel.  Life  has  not  left  me  igno- 
rant. I  know  what  a  precarious  thing  boys'  purity  is,  even  when 
it  has  the  appearance  of  being  most  intact.  And  besides,  I  don't 
think  that  the  youths  who  are  chastest  turn  into  the  best  hus- 
bands— nor  even,  unfortunately,  the  most  faithful!"  she  added, 
smiling  sadly.  "And  then  their  father's  example  made  me  wish 
other  virtues  for  my  sons.  But  I  am  afraid  of  their  taking  to 
debauchery  or  to  degrading  liaisons.  Olivier  is  easily  led  astray. 
You  will  have  it  at  heart  to  keep  him  straight.  I  think  you 
will  be  able  to  do  him  good.  It  only  rests  with  you.  ,  .  /' 

These  words  filled  me  with  confusion. 

"You  make  me  out  better  than  I  am." 

That  is  all  I  could  find  to  say,  in  the  stupidest,  stiffest  way. 
She  went  on  with  exquisite  delicacy: 

"It  is  Olivier  who  will  make  you  better.  With  love's  help 
what  can  one  not  obtain  from  oneself?" 

"Does  Oscar  know  he  is  with  me?"  I  asked,  to  put  a  little  air 
between  us. 

"He  does  not  even  know  he  is  in  Paris.  I  told  you  that  he  pays 
very  little  attention  to  his  sons.  That  is  why  I  counted  on  you  to 
speak  to  George.  Have  you  done  so?" 

"No — not  yet." 

Pauline's  brow  grew  suddenly  sombre. 

"I  am  becoming  more  and  more  anxious.  He  has  an  air  of 
assurance,  which  seems  to  me  a  combination  of  recklessness. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  296 

cynicism,  presumption.  He  works  well.  His  masters  are  pleased 
with  him;  my  anxiety  has  nothing  to  lay  hold  of.  .  .  ." 

Then  all  of  a  sudden,  throwing  aside  her  calm  and  speaking 
with  an  excitement  such  that  I  barely  recognized  her: 

"Do  you  realize  what  my  life  is?"  she  exclaimed.  "I  have 
restricted  my  happiness;  year  by  year,  I  have  been  obliged  to 
narrow  it  down;  one  by  one,  I  have  curtailed  my  hopes.  I  have 
given  in;  I  have  tolerated;  I  have  pretended  not  to  understand, 
not  to  see.  .  .  .  But  all  the  same,  one  clings  to  something,  how- 
ever small;  and  when  even  that  fails  one!  ...  In  the  evening 
he  comes  and  works  beside  me  under  the  lamp;  when  some- 
times he  raises  his  head  from  his  book,  it  isn't  affection  that  I 
see  in  his  look — it's  defiance.  I  haven't  deserved  it.  .  .  .  Some- 
times it  seems  to  me  suddenly  that  all  my  love  for  him  is  turned 
to  hatred;  and  I  wish  that  I  had  never  had  any  children." 

Her  voice  trembled.  I  took  her  hand. 

"Olivier  will  repay  you,  I  vouch  for  it." 

She  made  an  effort  to  recover  herself. 

"Yes,  I  am  mad  to  speak  so;  as  if  I  hadn't  three  sons.  When  I 
think  of  one,  I  forget  the  others.  .  .  .  You'll  think  me  very 
unreasonable,  but  there  are  really  moments  when  reason  isn't 
enough." 

"And  yet  what  I  admire  most  about  you  is  your  reasonable- 
ness," said  I  baldly,  in  the  hopes  of  calming  her.  "The  other  day, 
you  talked  about  Oscar  so  wisely.  .  .  ." 

Pauline  drew  herself  up  abruptly.  She  looked  at  me  and 
shrugged  her  shoulders. 

"It's  always  when  a  woman  appears  most  resigned  that  she 
seems  the  most  reasonable,"  she  cried,  almost  vindictively. 

This  reflection  irritated  me,  by  reason  of  its  very  justice.  In 
order  not  to  show  it,  I  asked : 

"Anything  new  about  the  letters?" 

"New?  New?  .  .  .  What  on  earth  that's  new  can  happen  be- 
tween Oscar  and  me?" 

"He  was  expecting  an  explanation." 

"So  was  I.  I  was  expecting  an  explanation.  All  one's  life 
long  one  expects  explanations." 


297  PAULINE 

"Well,  but,"  I  continued,  rather  annoyed,  "Oscar  felt  that  he 
was  in  a  false  situation." 

"But,  my  dear  friend,  you  know  well  enough  that  nothing 
lasts  more  eternally  than  a  false  situation.  It's  the  business  of 
you  novelists  to  try  to  solve  them.  In  real  life  nothing  is  solved; 
everything  continues.  We  remain  in  our  uncertainty;  and  we 
shall  remain  to  the  very  end  without  knowing  what  to  make  of 
things.  In  the  mean  time  life  goes  on  and  on,  the  same  as  ever. 
And  one  gets  resigned  to  that  too;  as  one  does  to  everything 
else  ...  as  one  does  to  everything.  Well,  well,  good-bye." 

I  was  painfully  affected  by  a  new  note  in  the  sound  of  her 
voice,  which  I  had  never  heard  before;  a  kind  of  aggressive- 
ness, which  forced  me  to  think  (not  at  the  actual  moment,  per- 
haps, but  when  I  recalled  our  conversation)  that  Pauline  ac- 
cepted my  relations  with  Olivier  much  less  easily  than  she  said; 
less  easily  than  all  the  rest.  I  am  willing  to  believe  that  she  does 
not  exactly  reprobate  them,  that  from  some  points  of  view  she 
is  glad  of  them,  as  she  lets  me  understand;  but,  perhaps  with- 
out owning  it  to  herself,  she  is  none  the  less  jealous  of  them. 

This  is  the  only  explanation  I  can  discover  for  her  sudden  out- 
burst of  revolt,  so  soon  after,  and  on  a  subject  which,  on  the 
whole,  she  had  much  less  at  heart.  It  was  as  though  by  grant- 
ing me  at  first  what  cost  her  more,  she  had  exhausted  her  whole 
stock  of  benignity  and  suddenly  found  herself  with  none  left. 
Hence  her  intemperate,  her  almost  extravagant  language,  which 
must  have  astonished  her  herself,  when  she  came  to  recall  it, 
and  in  which  her  jealousy  unconsciously  betrayed  itself. 

In  reality,  I  ask  myself,  what  can  be  the  state  of  mind  of  a 
woman  who  is  not  resigned?  An  "honest  woman,"  I  mean.  .  .  . 
As  if  what  is  called  "honesty"  in  woman  did  not  always  imply 
resignation ! 

This  evening  Olivier  is  perceptibly  better.  But  returning 
life  brings  anxiety  along  with  it.  I  reassure  him  by  every  device 
in  my  power. 

"His  duel?" — Dhurmer  has  run  away  into  the  country.  One 
really  can't  run  after  him. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  298 

"The  review?" — Bercail  is  in  charge  of  it. 

"The  things  he  had  left  at  Passavant's?" — This  is  the  thorn- 
iest point.  I  had  to  admit  that  George  had  been  unable  to  get 
possession  of  them;  but  I  have  promised  to  go  and  fetch  them 
myself  to-morrow.  He  is  afraid,  from  what  I  can  gather,  that 
Passavant  may  keep  them  as  a  hostage;  inadmissable  for  a  sin- 
gle moment! 

Yesterday,  I  was  sitting  up  late  in  the  studio,  after  having 
written  this,  when  I  heard  Olivier  call  me.  In  a  moment  I  was 
by  his  side. 

"I  should  have  come  myself,  only  I  was  too  weak,"  he  said. 
"I  tried  to  get  up,  but  when  I  stand,  my  head  turns  round  and 
I  was  afraid  of  falling.  No,  no,  I'm  not  feeling  worse;  on  the 
contrary.  But  I  had  to  speak  to  you. 

"You  must  promise  me  something.  .  .  .  Never  to  try  and  fmd 
out  why  I  wanted  to  kill  myself  the  other  night.  I  don't  think 
I  know  myself.  I  can't  remember.  Even  if  I  tried  to  tell  you, 
upon  my  honour,  I  shouldn't  be  able  to.  .  .  .  But  you  mustn't 
think  that  it's  because  of  anything  mysterious  in  my  life,  any- 
thing you  don't  know  about."  Then,  in  a  whisper:  "And  don't 
imagine  either  that  it  was  because  I  was  ashamed.  .  .  ." 

Although  we  were  in  the  dark,  he  hid  his  face  in  my  shoulder. 

"Or  if  I  am  ashamed,  it  is  of  the  dinner  the  other  evening; 
of  being  drunk,  of  losing  my  temper,  of  crying;  and  of  this 
summer  .  .  .  and  of  having  waited  for  you  so  badly." 

Then  he  protested  that  none  of  all  that  was  part  of  him  any 
more;  that  it  was  all  that  that  he  had  wanted  to  kill — that  he 
had  killed — that  he  had  wiped  out  of  his  life. 

I  felt,  in  his  very  agitation,  how  weak  he  still  was,  and  rocked 
him  in  my  arms,  like  a  child,  without  saying  anything.  He  was 
in  need  of  rest;  his  silence  made  me  hope  he  was  asleep;  but  at 
last  I  heard  him  murmur: 

"When  I  am  with  you,  I  am  too  happy  to  sleep." 

He  did  not  let  me  leave  him  till  morning. 


XII 

EDOUARD  AND   THEN   STROUVILHOU 
VISIT   PASSAVANT 

Bernard  arrived  early  that  morning.  Olivier  was  still  asleep. 
As  on  the  preceding  days,  Bernard  settled  himself  down  at  his 
friend's  bedside  with  a  book,  which  allowed  Edouard  to  go  off 
guard,  in  order  to  call  on  the  Comte  de  Passavant,  as  he  had 
promised.  At  such  an  early  hour  he  was  sure  to  be  in. 

The  sun  was  shining;  a  keen  air  was  scouring  the  trees  of 
their  last  leaves;  everything  seemed  limpid,  bathed  in  azure. 
Edouard  had  not  been  out  for  three  days.  His  heart  was  dilated 
by  an  immense  joy;  and  even  his  whole  being,  like  an  opened, 
empty  wrapping,  seemed  floating  on  a  shoreless  sea,  a  divine 
ocean  of  loving-kindness.  Love  and  fine  weather  have  this 
power  of  boundlessly  enlarging  our  contours. 

Edouard  knew  that  he  would  want  a  taxi  to  bring  back 
Olivier's  things;  but  he  was  in  no  hurry  to  take  one;  he  en- 
joyed walking.  The  state  of  benevolence  in  which  he  felt  him- 
self towards  the  whole  world,  was  no  good  preparation  for 
facing  Passavant.  He  told  himself  that  he  ought  to  execrate 
him;  he  went  over  in  his  mind  all  his  grievances — but  they 
had  ceased  to  sting.  This  rival,  whom  only  yesterday  he  had  so 
detested,  he  could  detest  no  longer — he  had  ousted  him  too 
completely.  At  any  rate  he  could  not  detest  him  that  morning. 
And  as,  on  the  other  hand,  he  thought  it  prudent  that  no  trace 
of  this  reversal  of  feeling  should  appear,  for  fear  of  its  betraying 
his  happiness,  he  would  have  gladly  evaded  the  interview.  And 
indeed,  why  the  dickens  was  he  going  to  it?  He!  Edouard! 
Going  to  the  Rue  de  Babylone,  to  ask  for  Olivier's  things — on 
what  pretext?  He  had  undertaken  the  commission  very  thought- 
lessly, he  told  himself,  as  he  walked  along;  it  would  imply  that 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  300 

Olivier  had  chosen  to  take  up  his  abode  with  him — exactly 
what  he  wanted  to  conceal.  .  .  .  Too  late,  however,  to  draw 
back;  Olivier  had  his  promise.  At  any  rate,  he  must  be  very 
cold  with  Passavant,  very  firm.  A  taxi  went  by  and  he  hailed  it. 

Edouard  knew  Passavant  ill.  He  was  ignorant  of  one  of 
the  chief  traits  of  his  character.  No  one  had  ever  succeeded 
in  catching  Passavant  out;  it  was  unbearable  to  him  to  be 
worsted.  In  order  not  to  acknowledge  his  defeats  to  himself, 
he  always  affected  to  have  desired  his  fate,  and  whatever 
happened  to  him,  he  pretended  that  that  was  what  he  wished. 
As  soon  as  he  understood  that  Olivier  was  escaping  him,  his 
one  care  was  to  dissemble  his  rage.  Far  from  attempting  to  run 
after  him,  and  risk  being  ridiculous,  he  forced  himself  to  keep 
a  stiff  lip  and  shrug  his  shoulders.  His  emotions  were  never  too 
violent  to  keep  under  control.  Some  people  congratulate  them- 
selves on  this,  and  refuse  to  acknowledge  that  they  owe  their 
mastery  over  themselves  less  to  their  force  of  character  than  to 
a  certain  poverty  of  temperament.  I  don't  allow  myself  to  gen- 
eralize; let  us  suppose  that  what  I  have  said  applies  only  to 
Passavant.  He  did  not  therefore  find  much  difficulty  in  persuad- 
ing himself  that  he  had  had  enough  of  Olivier;  that  during 
these  two  summer  months  he  had  exhausted  the  charm  of  an 
adventure  which  ran  the  risk  of  encumbering  his  life;  that,  for 
the  rest,  he  had  exaggerated  the  boy's  beauty,  his  grace  and 
his  intellectual  resources;  that,  indeed,  it  was  high  time  he 
should  open  his  eyes  to  the  inconveniences  of  confiding  the 
management  of  a  review  to  anyone  so  young  and  inexperienced. 
Taking  everything  into  consideration,  Strouvilhou  would  serve 
his  purpose  far  better  (as  regards  the  review,  that  is).  He  had 
written  to  him  and  appointed  him  to  come  and  see  him  that 
very  morning. 

Let  us  add  too  that  Passavant  was  mistaken  as  to  the  cause 
of  Olivier's  desertion.  He  thought  he  had  made  him  jealous 
by  his  attentions  to  Sarah;  he  was  pleased  with  this  idea  which 
flattered  his  self-conceit;  his  vexation  was  soothed  by  it. 

He  was  expecting  Strouvilhou;  and  as  he  had  given  orders 
that  he  was  to  be  let  in  at  once,  Edouard  benefited  by  the  in- 


301  STROUVILHOU   AT   PASSAVANT'S 

structions  and  was  shown  in  to  Passavant  without  being  an- 
nounced. 

Passavant  gave  no  signs  of  his  surprise.  Fortunately  for  him, 
the  part  he  had  to  play  was  suited  to  his  temperament  and  he 
was  easily  able  to  switch  his  mind  on  to  it.  As  soon  as  Edouard 
had  explained  the  motive  of  his  visit: 

"I'm  delighted  to  hear  what  you  say.  Then  really?  You're 
willing  to  look  after  him?  It  doesn't  put  you  out  too  much?  .  .  . 
Olivier  is  a  charming  boy,  but  he  was  beginning  to  be  terribly 
in  my  way  here.  I  didn't  like  to  let  him  feel  it — he's  so  nice.  .  .  . 
And  I  knew  he  didn't  want  to  go  back  to  his  parents.  .  .  .  Once 
one  has  left  one's  parents,  you  know —  .  .  .Oh!  but  now  I 
come  to  think  of  it,  his  mother  is  a  half-sister  of  yours,  isn't 
she?  ...  Or  something  of  that  kind?  Olivier  must  have  told 
me  so,  I  expect.  Then,  nothing  could  be  more  natural  than  that 
he  should  stay  with  you.  No  one  can  possibly  smile  at  it" 
(though  he  himself  didn't  fail  to  do  so  as  he  said  the  words). 
"With  me,  you  understand,  it  was  rather  more  shady.  In  fact, 
that  was  one  of  the  reasons  that  made  me  anxious  for  him  to 
go.  .  .  .  Though  I  am  by  no  means  in  the  habit  of  minding 
public  opinion.  No;  it  was  in  his  own  interest  rather.  .  .  ." 

The  conversation  had  not  begun  badly;  but  Passavant  could 
not  resist  the  pleasure  of  pouring  a  few  drops  of  his  poisonous 
perfidy  on  Edouard's  happiness.  He  always  kept  a  supply  on 
hand;  one  never  knows  what  may  happen. 

Edouard  felt  his  patience  giving  way.  But  he  suddenly 
thought  of  Vincent;  Passavant  would  probably  have  news  of 
him.  He  had  indeed  determined  not  to  answer  Douviers,  should 
he  question  him;  but  he  thought  it  would  be  a  good  thing  to  be 
himself  acquainted  with  the  facts,  in  order  the  better  to  avoid 
his  enquiries.  It  would  strengthen  his  resistance.  He  seized  this 
pretext  as  a  diversion. 

"Vincent  has  not  written  to  me,"  said  Passavant;  "but  I  have 
had  a  letter  from  Lady  Griffith — you  know — the  successor — in 
which  she  speaks  of  him  at  length.  See,  here  it  is.  .  .  .  After  all, 
I  don't  know  why  you  shouldn't  read  it." 

He  handed  him  the  letter,  and  Edouard  read: 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  302 

25th  August 

My  dear,^ 

The  prince's  yacht  is  leaving  Dakar  without  us.  Who  knows 
where  we  shall  be  when  you  get  this  letter  which  it  is  taking 
with  it?  Perhaps  on  the  banks  of  the  Casamance,  where  Vincent 
wants  to  botanize,  and  1  to  shoot.  I  don't  exactly  know  whether 
it  is  1  who  am  carrying  him  off,  or  he  me;  or  whether  it  isn't 
rather  that  we  have  both  of  us  fallen  into  the  clutches  of  the 
demon  of  adventure.  He  was  introduced  to  us  by  the  demon  of 
boredom,  whose  acquaintance  we  made  on  board  ship.  .  .  . 
Ah,  cher!  one  must  live  on  a  yacht  to  know  what  boredom  is. 
In  rough  weather  life  is  just  bearable;  one  has  one's  share  of 
the  vessel's  agitation.  But  after  Teneriffe,  not  a  breath;  not 
a  wrinkle  on  the  sea. 

"...  grand  miroir 

De  mon  desespoir." 
And  do  you  know  what  I  have  been  engaged  in  doing  ever 
since?  In  hating  Vincent.  Yes,  my  dear,  love  seemed  too  taste- 
less, so  we  have  gone  in  for  hating  each  other.  In  reality  it 
began  long  before;  really,  as  soon  as  we  got  on  board;  at 
first  it  was  only  irritation,  a  smouldering  animosity,  which 
didn't  prevent  closer  encounters.  With  the  fine  weather,  it  be- 
came ferocious.  Oh!  I  know  now  what  it  is  to  feel  passion  for 
someone.  .  .  . 

The  letter  went  on  for  some  time  longer. 

"I  don't  need  to  read  any  further,"  said  Edouard,  giving  it 
back  to  Passavant.  "When  is  he  coming  back?" 

"Lady  Griffith  doesn't  speak  of  returning." 

Passavant  was  mortified  that  Edouard  showed  so  little  appe- 
tite for  this  letter.  Since  he  had  allowed  him  to  read  it,  such  a 
lack  of  curiosity  must  be  considered  as  an  affront.  He  enjoyed 
rejecting  other  people's  offers,  but  could  not  endure  to  have  his 
own  disdained.  Lilian's  letter  had  filled  him  with  delight.  He 
had  a  certain  affection  for  her  and  Vincent;  and  had  even 
proved  to  his  own  satisfaction  that  he  was  capable  of  being  kind 
to  them  and  helpful;  but  as  soon  as  one  got  on  without  it,  his 
affection  dwindled.  That  his  two  friends  should  not  have  set  sail 

1  In  English  in  the  original. 


303  STROUVILHOU  AT   PASSAVANT'S 

for  perfect  bliss  when  they  left  him,  tempted  him  to  think: 
"Serves  them  right!" 

As  for  Edouard,  his  early  morning  felicity  was  too  genuine  for 
him  not  to  be  made  uncomfortable  by  the  picture  of  such  out- 
rageous feelings.  It  was  quite  unaffectedly  that  he  gave  the  let- 
ter back. 

Passavant  felt  it  essential  to  recover  the  lead  at  once: 

"Oh!  I  wanted  to  sa}'  too — you  know  that  I  had  thought  of 
making  Olivier  editor  of  a  review.  Of  course  there's  no  further 
question  of  that." 

"Of  course  not,"  rejoined  Edouard,  whom  Passavant  had  un- 
wittingly relieved  of  a  considerable  anxiety.  He  understood  by 
Edouard's  tone  that  he  had  played  into  his  hand,  and  without 
even  giving  himself  the  time  to  bite  his  lips : 

"Olivier's  things  are  in  the  room  he  was  occupying.  You  have 
a  taxi,  I  suppose?  I'll  have  them  brought  down  to  you.  By  the 
bye,  how  is  he?" 

"Very  well." 

Passavant  had  risen.  Edouard  did  the  same.  They  parted  with 
the  coldest  of  bows. 

The  Comte  de  Passavant  had  been  terribly  put  out  by 
Edouard's  visit.  He  heaved  a  sigh  of  relief  when  Strouvilhou 
came  into  the  room. 

Although  Strouvilhou,  on  his  side,  was  perfectly  able  to  hold 
his  own,  Passavant  felt  at  ease  with  him — or,  to  be  more  ac- 
curate, treated  him  in  a  free  and  easy  manner.  No  doubt  his 
opponent  was  by  no  means  despicable,  but  he  considered  him- 
self his  match,  and  piqued  himself  on  proving  it. 

"My  dear  Strouvilhou,  take  a  seat,"  said  he,  pushing  an  arm- 
chair towards  him.  "I  am  really  glad  to  see  you  again." 

"Monsieur  le  Comte  sent  for  me.  Here  I  am  entirely  at  his 
service." 

Strouvilhou  liked  affecting  a  kind  of  flunkey's  insolence  with 
Passavant,  but  Passavant  knew  him  of  old. 

"Let's  get  to  the  point;  it's  time  to  come  out  into  the  open. 
You've  already  tried  your  hand  at  a  good  many  trades.  .  .  . 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  304 

I  thought  to-day  of  proposing  you  an  actual  dictatorship — 
only  in  the  realms  of  literature,  let  us  hasten  to  add." 

"A  pity!"  Then,  as  Passavant  held  out  his  cigarette  case:  "If 
you'll  allow  me,  I  prefer  .  .  ." 

"I'll  allow  nothing  of  the  kind.  Your  horrid  contraband 
cigars  make  the  room  stink.  I  can't  understand  how  anyone 
can  smoke  such  stuflF." 

"Oh!  I  don't  pretend  that  I  rave  about  them.  But  they're 
a  nuisance  to  one's  neighbours." 

"Playful  as  ever?" 

"Not  altogether  an  idiot,  you  know." 

And  without  replying  directly  to  Passavant's  proposal,  Strou- 
vilhou  thought  proper  to  establish  his  positions;  afterwards  he 
would  see.  He  went  on: 

"Philanthropy  was  never  one  of  my  strong  points." 

"I  know,  I  know,"  said  Passavant. 

"Nor  egoism  either.  That's  what  you  don't  know.  .  .  . 
People  want  to  make  us  believe  that  man's  single  escape  from 
egoism  is  a  still  more  disgusting  altruism!  As  for  me,  I  main- 
tain that  if  there's  anything  more  contemptible  and  more  abject 
than  a  man,  it's  a  lot  of  men.  No  reasoning  will  ever  persuade 
me  that  the  addition  of  a  number  of  sordid  units  can  result  in 
an  enchanting  total.  I  never  happen  to  get  into  a  tram  or  a  train 
without  hoping  that  a  good  old  accident  will  reduce  the  whole 
pack  of  living  garbage  to  a  pulp;  yes,  good  Lord!  and  myself 
into  the  bargain.  I  never  enter  a  theatre  without  praying  that 
the  chandelier  may  come  crashing  down,  or  that  a  bomb  may 
go  off;  and  even  if  I  had  to  be  blown  up  too,  I'd  be  only  too 
glad  to  bring  it  along  in  my  coat  pocket — if  I  weren't  reserving 
myself  for  something  better.  You  were  saying?  .  .  ." 

"No,  nothing;  go  on,  I'm  listening.  You're  not  one  of  those 
orators  who  need  the  stimulus  of  contradiction  to  keep  them 
going." 

"The  fact  is,  I  thought  I  heard  you  offer  me  some  of  your 
incomparable  port." 

Passavant  smiled. 


305  STROUVILHOU   AT   PASSAVANT'S 

"Keep  the  bottle  beside  you,"  he  said,  as  he  passed  it  to  him. 
"Empty  it  if  you  like,  but  talk." 

Strouvilhou  filled  his  glass,  sat  comfortably  back  in  his  big 
arm-chair  and  began : 

"I  don't  know  if  I've  got  what  people  call  a  hard  heart;  in 
my  opinion,  I've  got  too  much  indignation,  too  much  disgust 
in  my  composition — not  that  I  care.  It  is  true  that  for  a  long 
time  past  I  have  repressed  in  that  particular  organ  of  mine 
everything  which  ran  the  risk  of  softening  it.  But  I  am  not  in- 
capable of  admiration,  and  of  a  sort  of  absurd  devotion;  for, 
in  so  far  as  I  am  a  man,  I  despise  and  hate  myself  as  much  as 
I  do  my  neighbours.  I  hear  it  repeated  everywhere  and  con- 
stantly that  literature,  art  and  science  work  together  in  the  long 
run  for  the  good  of  mankind;  and  that's  enough  to  make  me 
loathe  them.  But  there's  nothing  to  prevent  me  from  turning 
the  proposition  round,  and  then  I  breathe  again.  Yes,  what  for 
my  part  I  like  to  imagine  is,  on  the  contrary,  a  servile  human- 
ity working  towards  the  production  of  some  cruel  master-piece; 
a  Bernard  Palissy  (how  they  have  deaved  us  with  that  fellow!) 
burning  his  wife  and  children  to  get  a  varnish  for  a  fine  plate. 
I  like  turning  problems  round;  I  can't  help  it,  my  mind  is  so 
constructed  that  they  keep  steadier  when  they  are  standing  on 
their  heads.  And  if  I  can't  endure  the  thought  of  a  Christ 
sacrificing  himself  for  the  thankless  salvation  of  all  the  frightful 
people  I  knock  up  against  daily,  I  imagine  with  some  satisfac- 
tion, and  indeed  a  kind  of  serenity,  the  rotting  of  that  vile  mob 
in  order  to  produce  a  Christ  .  .  .  though,  in  reality,  I  should 
prefer  something  else;  for  all  His  teaching  has  only  served  to 
plunge  us  deeper  into  the  mire.  The  trouble  comes  from  the 
selfishness  of  the  ferocious.  Imagine  what  magnificent  things 
an  unselfish  ferocity  would  produce!  When  we  take  care  of  the 
poor,  the  feeble,  the  rickety,  the  injured,  we  are  making  a  great 
mistake;  and  that  is  why  1  hate  religion — because  it  teaches  us 
to.  That  deep  peace,  which  philanthropists  themselves  pretend 
they  derive  from  the  contemplation  of  nature,  and  its  fauna  and 
flora,  comes  from  this — that  in  the  savage  state,  it  is  only  robust 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  306 

creatures  that  flourish;  all  the  rest  is  refuse  and  serves  as 
manure.  But  people  won't  see  it;  won't  admit  it." 

"Yes,  yes;  I  admit  it  willingly.  Go  on." 

"And  tell  me  whether  it  isn't  shameful,  wretched  .  .  .  that 
men  have  done  so  much  to  get  superb  breeds  of  horses,  cattle, 
poultry,  cereals,  flowers,  and  that  they  themselves  are  still  seek- 
ing a  relief  for  their  sufferings  in  medicine,  a  palliative  in  char- 
ity, a  consolation  in  religion,  and  oblivion  in  drink.  What  we 
ought  to  work  at  is  the  amelioration  of  the  breed.  But  all 
selection  implies  the  suppression  of  failures,  and  this  is  what  our 
fool  of  a  Christianized  society  cannot  consent  to.  It  will  not 
even  take  upon  itself  to  castrate  degenerates — and  those  are 
the  most  prolific.  What  we  want  is  not  hospitals,  but  stud 
farms." 

"Upon  my  soul,  Strouvilhou,  I  like  you  when  you  talk  so." 

"I  am  afraid.  Monsieur  le  Comte,  that  you  have  misunder- 
stood me.  You  thought  me  a  sceptic,  and  in  reality  I  am  an 
idealist,  a  mystic.  Scepticism  has  never  been  any  good.  One 
knows  for  that  matter  where  it  leads — to  tolerance!  I  consider 
sceptics  people  without  imagination,  without  ideals — fools.  .  .  . 
And  I  am  not  ignorant  of  all  the  delicacies,  the  sentimental 
subtleties  which  would  be  suppressed  by  the  production  of  this 
robust  humanity;  but  no  one  would  be  there  to  regret  the  deli- 
cacies, since  the  people  capable  of  appreciating  them  would  be 
suppressed  too.  Don't  make  any  mistake — I  am  not  without 
what  is  called  culture,  and  1  know  that  certain  among  the  Greeks 
had  caught  a  glimpse  of  my  ideal;  at  any  rate,  I  like  imagin- 
ing it,  and  remembering  that  Core,  daughter  of  Ceres,  went 
down  to  Hades  full  of  pity  for  the  shades;  but  that  after  she 
had  become  queen,  and  Pluto's  wife.  Homer  never  calls  her 
anything  but  'implacable  Proserpine.'  See  Odyssey,  Bk.  VI. 
'Implacable' — that's  what  every  man  who  pretends  to  be  virtu- 
ous owes  it  to  himself  to  be." 

"Glad  to  see  you  come  back  to  literature — that  is,  if  we  may 
be  said  ever  to  have  left  it.  Well  then,  virtuous  Strouvilhou, 
I  want  to  know  whether  you'll  consent  to  become  the  implacable 
editor  of  a  review?" 


307  STROUVILHOU   AT   PASSAVANT'S 

"To  tell  the  truth,  my  dear  count,  I  must  own  that  of  all 
nauseating  human  emanations,  literature  is  one  of  those  which 
disgust  me  most.  I  can  see  nothing  in  it  but  compromise  and 
flattery.  And  I  go  so  far  as  to  doubt  whether  it  can  be  anything 
else — at  any  rate  until  it  has  made  a  clean  sweep  of  the  past. 
We  live  upon  nothing  but  feelings  which  have  been  taken  for 
granted  once  for  all  and  which  the  reader  imagines  he  experi- 
ences, because  he  believes  everything  he  sees  in  print;  the  author 
builds  on  this  as  he  does  on  the  conventions  which  he  believes 
to  be  the  foundations  of  his  art.  These  feelings  ring  as  false  as 
counters,  but  they  pass  current.  And  as  everyone  knows  that 
'bad  money  drives  out  good,'  a  man  who  should  offer  the  public 
real  coins  would  seem  to  be  defrauding  us.  In  a  world  in  which 
everyone  cheats,  it's  the  honest  man  who  passes  for  a  charlatan. 
I  give  you  fair  warning — if  I  edit  a  review,  it  will  be  in  order 
to  prick  bladders — in  order  to  demonetize  fine  feelings,  and 
those  promissory  notes  which  go  by  the  name  of  words." 

"Upon  my  soul,  I  should  very  much  like  to  know  how  you'll 
set  about  it." 

"Let  me  alone  and  you'll  soon  see  ...  I  have  often  thought 
it  over." 

"No  one  will  understand  what  you're  after;  no  one  will  fol- 
low you." 

"Oh,  come  now!  The  cleverest  young  men  of  the  present  day 
are  already  on  their  guard  against  poetical  inflation.  They  per- 
fectly recognize  a  gas  bag  when  they  see  one — even  in  the  dis- 
guise of  scientifically  elaborate  metre,  and  trimmed  up  with  all 
the  hackneyed  effusions  of  high-sounding  lyrical  verse.  One  can 
always  find  hands  for  a  work  of  destruction.  Shall  we  found  a 
school  with  no  other  object  but  to  pull  things  down?  .  .  . 
Would  you  be  afraid?" 

"No.  ...  So  long  as  my  garden  isn't  trampled  on." 

"There's  enough  to  be  done  elsewhere  .  .  .  en  attendant. 
The  moment  is  propitious.  I  know  many  a  young  man  who  is 
only  waiting  for  the  rallying  cry;  quite  young  ones.  .  .  .  Oh, 
yes,  I  know!  That's  what  you  like;  but  I  warn  you  they  aren't 
taking  any.  ...  I  have  often  wondered  by  what  miracle  paint- 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  308 

ing  has  gone  so  far  ahead,  and  how  it  happens  that  literature 
has  let  itself  be  outdistanced.  In  painting  to-day,  just  see  how 
the  'motif,'  as  it  used  to  be  called,  has  fallen  into  discredit. 
A  fine  subject!  It  makes  one  laugh.  Painters  don't  even  dare 
venture  on  a  portrait  unless  they  can  be  sure  of  avoiding  every 
trace  of  resemblance.  If  we  manage  our  afifairs  well,  and  leave 
me  alone  for  that,  I  don't  ask  for  more  than  two  years  before 
a  future  poet  will  think  himself  dishonoured  if  anyone  can 
understand  a  word  of  what  he  says.  Yes,  Monsieur  le  Comte, 
will  you  wager?  All  sense,  all  meaning  will  be  considered  anti- 
poetical.  Illogicality  shall  be  our  guiding  star.  What  a  fine 
title  for  a  review — The  Scavengers!" 

Passavant  had  listened  without  turning  a  hair. 

"Do  you  count  your  young  nephew  among  your  acolytes?" 
he  asked  after  a  pause. 

"Young  Leon  is  one  of  the  elect;  he  doesn't  let  the  flies  settle 
on  him,  either.  Really,  it's  a  pleasure  teaching  him.  Last  term 
he  thought  it  would  be  a  joke  to  cut  out  the  swotters  in  his 
form  and  carry  off  all  the  prizes.  Since  he  came  back  from  the 
holidays  he  has  let  his  work  go  to  the  deuce;  I  haven't  the 
least  idea  what  he's  hatching;  but  I  have  every  confidence  in 
him,  and  I  wouldn't  for  the  world  interfere." 

"Will  you  bring  him  to  see  me?" 

"Monsieur  le  Comte  is  joking,  no  doubt.  .  .  .  Well,  then, 
this  review?" 

"We'll  see  about  it  later.  I  must  have  time  to  let  your  plans 
mature  in  my  mind.  In  the  mean  time,  you  might  really  find 
me  a  secretary.  I'm  not  satisfied  with  the  one  I  had." 

"I'll  send  you  little  Cob-Lafleur  to-morrow.  I  shall  be  seeing 
him  this  afternoon,  and  I  make  no  doubt  he'll  suit  you." 

"Scavenger  style?" 

"A  little." 

"Ex  uno  .  .  ." 

"Oh,  no;  don't  judge  them  all  from  him.  He  is  one  of  the 
moderate  ones.  Just  right  for  you." 

Strouvilhou  rose. 


309  STROUVILHOU   AT   PASSAVANT'S 

"A  propos,"  said  Passavant,  "I  haven't  given  you  my  book, 
I  think.  I'm  sorry  not  to  have  a  first  edition  left.  ,  .  ." 

"As  I  don't  mean  to  sell  it,  it  isn't  of  the  slightest  impor- 
tance." 

"It's  only  because  the  print's  better." 

"Oh!  as  I  don't  mean  to  read  it  either  .  .  .  Au  revoir.  And  if 
the  spirit  moves  you,  I'm  at  your  service.  I  wish  you  good 
morning." 


EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL:   DOUVIERS' 
PROFITENDIEU 

Brought  back  Olivier's  things  from  Passavant's.  As  soon  as  I 
got  home,  set  to  work  on  The  Counterfeiters.  My  exaltation  is 
calm  and  lucid.  My  joy  is  such  as  I  have  never  known  before. 
Wrote  thirty  pages  without  hesitation,  without  a  single  erasure. 
The  whole  drama,  like  a  nocturnal  landscape  suddenly  illumi- 
nated by  a  flash  of  lightning,  emerges  out  of  the  darkness,  very 
different  from  what  I  had  been  trying  to  invent.  The  books 
which  I  have  hitherto  written  seem  to  me  like  the  ornamental 
pools  in  public  gardens — their  contours  are  defined — perfect 
perhaps,  but  the  water  they  contain  is  captive  and  lifeless.  I 
wish  it  now  to  run  freely,  according  to  its  bent,  sometimes  swift, 
sometimes  slow;  I  choose  not  to  foresee  its  windings. 

X.  maintains  that  a  good  novelist,  before  he  begins  to  write 
his  book,  ought  to  know  how  it  is  going  to  finish.  As  for  me, 
who  let  mine  flow  where  it  will,  I  consider  that  life  never  pre- 
sents us  with  anything  which  may  not  be  looked  upon  as  a 
fresh  starting  point,  no  less  than  as  a  termination.  "Might  be 
continued" — these  are  the  words  with  which  I  should  like  to 
finish  my  Counter feiten. 

Visit  from  Douviers.  He  is  certainly  an  excellent  fellow. 

As  I  exaggerated  my  sympathy  for  him,  I  was  obliged  to 
submit  to  his  effusions,  which  were  rather  embarrassing.  All  the 
time  I  was  talking  to  him,  I  kept  repeating  to  myself  La  Roche- 
foucauld's words:  "I  am  very  little  susceptible  to  pity;  and 
should  like  not  to  be  so  at  all  ...  I  consider  that  one  ought 
to  content  oneself  with  showing  it  and  carefully  refrain  from 
feeling  it."  And  yet  my  sympathy  was  real,  undeniable,  and  I 


311  DOUVIERS.   PROFITENDIEU 

was  moved  to  tears.  Truth  to  tell,  my  tears  seemed  to  console 
him  better  than  my  words.  I  almost  believe  that  he  gave  up 
being  unhappy  as  soon  as  he  saw  me  cry. 

I  was  firmly  resolved  not  to  tell  him  the  name  of  the  se- 
ducer; but  to  my  surprise  he  did  not  ask  it.  I  think  his  jealousy 
dies  down  as  soon  as  he  no  longer  feels  Laura's  eyes  upon  him. 
In  any  case,  its  energy  had  been  somewhat  diminished  by  the 
act  of  coming  to  see  me. 

There  is  something  illogical  in  his  case;  he  is  indignant  that 
the  other  man  should  have  deserted  Laura.  I  pointed  out  that 
if  it  had  not  been  for  his  desertion,  Laura  would  not  have 
come  back  to  him.  He  is  resolved  to  love  the  child  as  if  it  were 
his  own.  Who  knows  whether  he  would  ever  have  tasted  the 
joys  of  paternity  without  the  seducer?  I  took  good  care  not  to 
point  this  out  to. him,  for  at  the  recollection  of  his  insufficiencies, 
his  jealousy  becomes  more  acute.  But  then  it  belongs  to  the 'do- 
main of  vanity  and  ceases  to  interest  me. 

That  an  Othello  should  be  jealous  is  comprehensible;  the 
image  of  his  wife's  pleasure  obsesses  him.  But  when  a  Douviers 
becomes  jealous  it  can  only  be  because  he  imagines  he  ought 
to  be. 

And  no  doubt  he  nurses  this  passion  from  a  secret  need  to 
give  body  to  his  somewhat  unsubstantial  personage.  Happiness 
would  be  natural  to  him;  but  he  has  to  admire  himself  and 
he  esteems  only  what  is  acquired,  not  what  is  natural.  I  did  all 
I  could  therefore  to  persuade  him  that  simple  happiness  was 
more  meritorious  than  torments  and  very  difficult  to  attain. 
I  did  not  let  him  go  till  he  was  calm  again. 

Inconsistency.  Characters  in  a  novel  or  a  play  who  act  all 
the  way  through  exactly  as  one  expects  them  to.  .  .  .  This  con- 
sistency of  theirs,  which  is  held  up  to  our  admiration,  is  on  the 
contrary  the  very  thing  which  makes  us  recognize  that  they  are 
artificially  composed. 

Not  that  I  pretend  that  inconsistency  is  a  sure  indication  of 
naturalness,  for  one  often  meets,  especially  among  women,  af- 
fected inconsistencies;  and  on  the  other  hand,  in  some  few 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  312 

instances,  there  is  reason  to  admire  what  is  known  as  esprit  de 
suite;  but,  as  a  rule,  such  consecutiveness  is  obtained  only  by 
vain  and  obstinate  perseverance,  and  at  the  expense  of  all  nat- 
uralness. The  more  fundamentally  generous  an  individual  is, 
and  the  more  fertile  in  possibilities,  the  more  liable  he  is  to 
change,  and  the  less  willing  to  allow  his  future  to  be  decided 
by  his  past.  The  "jiistum  et  tenacem  propositi  virum,"  who  is 
held  up  to  us  as  a  model,  more  often  than  not  offers  a  stony  soil 
and  is  refractory  to  culture. 

I  have  known  some  of  yet  another  sort:  these  assiduously 
fabricate  for  themselves  a  self-conscious  originality,  and  after 
having  made  a  choice  of  certain  practices,  their  principal  pre- 
occupation is  never  to  depart  from  them,  to  remain  for  ever 
on  their  guard  and  allow  themselves  not  a  moment's  relaxation. 
(1  remember  X.,  who  refused  to  let  me  fill  his  glass  with  Mont- 
rachet  1904,  saying:  "I  don't  like  anything  but  Bordeaux."  As 
soon  as  I  pretended  it  was  a  Bordeaux,  he  thought  the  Mont- 
rachet  delectable.) 

When  I  was  younger,  I  used  to  make  resolutions,  which  1 
imagined  were  virtuous.  I  was  less  anxious  to  be  what  I  was, 
than  to  become  what  I  wished  to  be.  Now,  I  am  not  far  from 
thinking  that  in  irresolution  lies  the  secret  of  not  growing  old. 

Olivier  has  asked  me  what  I  am  working  at.  I  let  myself  be 
carried  away  into  talking  of  my  book,  and  even — he  seemed 
so  much  interested — into  reading  him  the  pages  I  had  just 
written.  I  was  afraid  of  what  he  would  say,  knowing  how  sweep- 
ing young  people's  judgments  are  and  how  difficult  they  find 
it  to  admit  another  point  of  view  from  their  own.  But  the 
few  remarks  which  he  diffidently  offered,  seemed  to  me  most 
judicious,  and  I  immediately  turned  them  to  account. 

My  breath,  my  life  comes  to  me  from  him — through  him. 

He  is  still  anxious  about  the  review  he  was  going  to  edit, 
and  particularly  about  the  story  which  he  wrote  at  Passavant's 
request  and  which  he  now  repudiates.  I  told  him  that  Passa- 
vant's new  arrangements  will  necessitate  the  re-casting  of  the 
first  number;  he  will  be  able  to  get  his  MS.  back. 


313  DOUVIERS.   PROFlTENDIEU 

Just  received  a  very  unexpected  visit  from  M.  le  juge  d'in- 
striLcticni  Profitendieu.  He  was  mopping  his  forehead  and 
breathing  heavily,  not  so  much,  it  seemed  to  me,  from  having 
come  up  my  six  flights  of  stairs,  as  from  embarrassment.  He 
kept  his  hat  in  his  hand  and  did  not  sit  down  till  I  pressed 
him  to.  He  is  a  handsome  man,  with  a  fine  figure  and  consider- 
able presence. 

"I  think  you  are  President  Molinier's  brother-in-law,"  he 
said.  "It  is  about  his  son  George  that  I  have  taken  the  liberty 
of  coming  to  see  you.  I  feel  sure  you  will  excuse  a  step  which 
at  first  sight  may  seem  indiscreet,  but  which  the  aff'ection  and 
esteem  I  have  for  my  colleague  will,  I  hope,  sufficiently  ex- 
plain." 

He  paused.  I  got  up  and  went  to  let  down  a  portiere,  for  fear 
the  charwoman,  who  is  very  inquisitive,  and  who  was,  I  knew, 
in  the  next  room,  should  overhear.  Profitendieu  approved  me 
with  a  smile. 

"In  my  capacity  as  juge  d' instruction,  I  have  an  affair  on  my 
hands  which  is  causing  me  extreme  embarrassment.  Your  young 
nephew  has  already  been  mixed  up  in  a  most  compromising 
manner  in  a  .  .  .  this  is  quite  between  ourselves,  I  beg  .  .  . 
in  a  somewhat  scandalous  adventure.  I  am  willing  to  believe, 
considering  his  extreme  youth,  that  he  was  taken  by  surprise, 
owing  to  his  simplicity — his  innocence;  but  I  may  say  that  it 
has  required  some  skill  on  my  part  to  .  .  .  ahem  .  .  .  cir- 
cumscribe this  affair,  without  injuring  the  interests  of  justice. 
In  the  face  of  a  second  breach — of  quite  another  kind,  I  hasten 
to  add — I  cannot  answer  for  it  that  young  George  will  get  off 
so  easily.  I  even  doubt  whether  it  is  in  the  boy's  own  interest  to 
try  to  get  him  off,  notwithstanding  all  my  desire  as  a  friend 
to  spare  your  brother-in-law  such  a  scandal.  Nevertheless  I  will 
try;  but  I  have  officers,  you  understand,  who  are  zealous,  and 
whom  I  am  not  always  able  to  restrain.  Or,  if  you  prefer  it,  I 
am  still  able  to  keep  them  in  hand  to-day,  but  to-morrow  I 
shall  be  unable  to.  And  I  thought  you  might  speak  to  your 
young  nephew  and  warn  him  of  the  risk  he  is  running." 

Profitendieu's  visit  (I  might  as  well  admit  it)  had  at  first 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  314 

alarmed  me  horribly;  but  as  soon  as  I  understood  that  he  had 
come  neither  as  an  enemy  nor  as  a  judge,  I  began  to  be  amused. 
I  was  a  great  deal  more  so  when  he  went  on : 

"For  some  time  past  a  certain  number  of  counterfeit  coins 
have  been  put  into  circulation.  So  far  I  am  informed.  But  I  have 
not  yet  succeeded  in  discovering  their  origin.  I  know,  however, 
that  young  George — quite  innocently,  I  am  willing  to  believe 
— is  one  of  those  who  circulate  them.  A  fev/  young  boys  of 
your  nephew's  age  are  lending  themselves  to  this  shameful  traf- 
fic. I  don't  doubt  that  their  simplicity  is  being  abused  and  that 
these  foolish  children  are  tools  in  the  hands  of  one  or  two  un- 
scrupulous elders.  We  should  have  had  no  difficulty  in  taking 
up  the  younger  delinquents  and  making  them  confess  the  origin 
of  the  coins;  but  1  am  only  too  well  aware  that  after  a  certain 
point  a  case  escapes  our  control,  so  to  speak;  that  is  to  say, 
we  cannot  go  back  on  the  police  court  proceedings,  and  we 
sometimes  find  ourselves  forced  to  become  acquainted  with 
things  we  should  prefer  to  ignore.  Upon  this  occasion,  I  have 
no  doubt  I  shall  discover  the  real  culprits  without  having  re- 
course to  the  minors'  evidence.  I  have  given  orders  therefore 
not  to  alarm  them.  But  my  orders  are  only  provisional.  I  don't 
want  your  nephew  to  force  me  to  countermand  them.  He  had 
better  be  told  that  the  authorities'  eyes  are  open.  It  wouldn't 
be  a  bad  thing  indeed  to  frighten  him  a  little;  he  is  on  a  down- 
ward course.  .  .  ." 

I  declared  I  would  do  my  best  to  warn  him,  but  Profitendieu 
seemed  not  to  hear  me.  His  eyes  became  vague.  He  repeated 
twice:  "on  what  is  called  a  downward  course,"  and  then  was 
silent. 

I  do  not  know  how  long  his  silence  lasted.  Without  his  having 
to  formulate  his  thoughts,  I  seemed  to  see  them  forming  in 
his  mind,  and  before  he  spoke,  I  already  heard  his  words: 

"I  am  a  father  myself,  sir.  .  .  ." 

Everything  he  had  been  saying  disappeared;  there  was  noth- 
ing left  between  us  but  Bernard.  The  rest  was  only  a  pretext; 
it  was  to  talk  of  him  that  he  had  come. 

If  effusions  make  me  feel  uncomfortable,  if  exaggerated  feel- 


315  DOUVIERS.    PROFITENDIEU 

ings  irritate  me,  nothing,  on  the  contrary,  could  have  been  more 
calculated  to  touch  me  than  this  restrained  emotion.  He  kept  it 
back  as  best  he  could,  but  with  so  great  an  effort  that  his  lips 
and  hands  trembled.  He  was  unable  to  continue.  He  suddenly 
hid  his  face  in  his  hands,  and  the  upper  part  of  his  body  was 
shaken  with  sobs: 

"You  see,"  he  stammered,  "you  see  how  miserable  a  child  can 
make  us," 

What  was  the  good  of  pretending?  Extremely  moved  myself, 
"If  Bernard  were  to  see  you,"  I  cried,  "his  heart  would  melt;  I 
can  vouch  for  it." 

At  the  same  time  I  felt  in  rather  an  awkward  situation.  Ber- 
nard had  hardly  ever  mentioned  his  father  to  me.  I  had  morally 
accepted  his  having  left  his  family,  ready  as  1  am  to  consider 
such  desertions  natural,  and  disposed  to  see  in  them  nothing 
but  what  will  be  to  the  child's  greatest  advantage.  In  Bernard's 
case,  there  was  the  additional  factor  of  his  bastardy.  .  .  .  But 
here  was  his  false  father  discovering  feelings  which  were  all 
the  stronger,  no  doubt,  that  they  were  beyond  control,  and 
all  the  more  sincere  that  they  were  in  no  way  obligatory.  In  the 
face  of  this  love,  this  grief,  I  was  forced  to  ask  myself  whether 
Bernard  had  done  right  to  leave.  I  had  no  longer  the  heart  to 
approve  him. 

"Make  use  of  me,  if  you  think  I  can  be  of  any  use,"  I  said, 
"if  you  think  that  I  ought  to  speak  to  him.  He  has  a  good 
heart." 

"I  know.  I  know.  .  .  .  Yes,  you  can  do  a  great  deal.  I  know 
he  was  with  you  this  summer.  My  police  work  is  well  done.  .  .  . 
I  know  too  that  he  is  going  up  for  his  viva  voce  this  very  day. 
I  chose  the  moment  I  knew  he  would  be  at  the  Sorbonne  to 
come  and  see  you.  I  was  afraid  of  meeting  him." 

For  some  minutes,  my  emotion  had  been  dwindling,  for  I 
had  just  noticed  that  the  verb  "to  know"  figured  in  nearly  all 
his  sentences.  I  immediately  became  less  interested  in  what  he 
was  saying  than  in  this  trick  of  speech,  which  was  perhaps 
professional. 

He  told  me  also  that  he  "knew"  that  Bernard  had  passed 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  316 

his  written  examination  brilliantly.  An  obliging  examiner,  who 
happened  to  be  a  friend  of  his,  had  enabled  him  to  see  his  son's 
French  essay,  which  it  appears  was  most  remarkable.  He  spoke 
of  Bernard  with  a  kind  of  restrained  admiration,  which  made 
me  wonder  whether  after  all  he  did  not  believe  he  was  really 
his  father. 

"Heavens!"  added  he,  "whatever  you  do,  don't  tell  him  what 
I  have  just  been  saying.  He  is  so  proud  by  nature,  so  easily 
offended!  ...  If  he  suspected  that  ever  since  he  left  I  have 
never  ceased  thinking  of  him,  following  him  .  .  .  But  all  the 
same,  you  can  tell  him  that  you  have  seen  me."  (He  breathed 
painfully  after  each  sentence.)  "You  can  tell  him,  what  no 
one  else  can,  that  I  am  not  angry  with  him";  then  with  a  voice 
that  grew  fainter:  "that  I  have  never  ceased  to  love  him  .  .  . 
like  a  son.  Yes,  I  know  that  you  know.  .  .  .  You  can  tell  him 
too  .  .  ."  and  without  looking  at  me,  with  difficulty,  in  a  state 
of  extreme  confusion  "that  his  mother  left  me  .  .  .  yes,  for 
good,  this  summer;  and  that  if  he  .  .  .  would  come  back, 
I  .  .  ." 

He  was  unable  to  finish. 

When  a  big,  strong,  matter-of-fact  man,  who  has  made  his 
way  in  life  and  is  firmly  established  in  his  career,  suddenly 
throws  aside  all  decorum  and  pours  out  his  heart  before  a 
stranger,  he  affords  him  (in  this  case  it  was  I)  a  most  singular 
spectacle.  I  was  able  once  more  to  verify,  as  I  have  often  done 
before,  that  I  am  more  easily  moved  by  the  effusions  of  an 
outsider  than  by  those  of  a  familiar  acquaintance.  (Will  ex- 
amine into  the  reason  of  this  another  time.) 

Profitendieu  did  not  conceal  that  he  had  at  first  been  preju- 
diced against  me,  not  having  understood,  and  still  not  under- 
standing, why  Bernard  had  left  his  home  to  join  me.  This  was 
what  had  prevented  him  from  coming  to  see  me  in  the  first 
place.  I  did  not  dare  tell  him  the  story  of  the  suit-case,  and 
merely  spoke  of  his  son's  friendship  for  Olivier,  which  had 
quickly  led  to  our  becoming  intimate  in  our  turn. 

"These  young  men,"  went  on  Profitendieu,  "start  off  in  life 
without  knowing  to  what  they  are  exposed.  No  doubt  their 


317  DOUVIERS.   PROFITENDIEU 

ignorance  of  danger  makes  their  strength.  But  we  who  know, 
we,  their  fathers,  tremble  for  them.  Our  solicitude  irritates  them, 
and  the  best  thing  is  to  let  them  see  it  as  little  as  possible.  I 
know  that  it  is  sometimes  very  troublesome  and  clumsy.  Rather 
than  incessantly  repeat  to  a  child  that  fire  burns,  let  us  consent 
to  his  burning  his  fingers.  Experience  is  a  better  instructor  than 
advice.  I  always  allowed  Bernard  the  greatest  possible  liberty 
— so  much  so,  that  he  fancied,  I  grieve  to  say,  that  I  was  in- 
different to  him.  I  am  afraid  that  was  his  mistake  and  the 
reason  of  his  running  away.  Even  then,  I  thought  it  was  better 
to  let  him  be;  though  I  kept  a  watch  on  him  all  the  time  with- 
out his  suspecting  it.  Thank  God,  I  had  the  means!"  (Evi- 
dently the  organization  of  his  police  was  Profitendieu's  special 
pride — this  was  the  third  time  he  had  alluded  to  it.)  "I  thought 
I  must  take  care  not  to  belittle  the  risks  of  his  initiative  in  the 
boy's  eyes.  Shall  I  own  to  you  that  his  rebellious  conduct,  not- 
withstanding the  pain  it  gave  me,  has  only  made  me  fonder  of 
him  than  ever?  It  seemed  to  me  a  proof  of  courage,  of  val- 
our. .  .  ." 

Now  that  he  felt  himself  on  confidential  terms,  the  worthy 
man  would  have  gone  on  for  ever.  I  tried  to  bring  the  conversa- 
tion back  to  what  interested  me  more  and,  cutting  him  short, 
asked  him  if  he  had  ever  seen  one  of  the  counterfeit  coins  of 
which  he  had  spoken.  I  was  curious  to  know  whether  they  were 
like  the  little  glass  piece  which  Bernard  had  shown  us.  I  had 
no  sooner  mentioned  this,  than  Profitendieu's  whole  countenance 
changed;  his  eyelids  half  closed  and  a  curious  light  burned 
in  his  eyes;  crow's  feet  appeared  upon  his  temples,  his  lips  tight- 
ened, his  features  were  all  drawn  upwards  in  his  efi'ort  at  atten- 
tion. There  was  no  further  question  of  anything  that  had  passed 
before.  The  judge  ousted  the  father  and  nothing  existed  for  him 
but  his  profession.  He  pressed  me  with  questions,  took  notes 
and  spoke  of  sending  a  police  officer  to  Saas-Fee  to  take  the 
names  of  the  visitors  in  the  hotel  books. 

"Though  in  all  likelihood,"  he  added,  "the  coin  you  saw  was 
given  to  the  grocer  by  an  adventurer  who  was  merely  passing 
through  the  place." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  318 

To  which  I  replied  that  Saas-Fee  was  at  the  further  end  of  an 
impasse  and  that  it  was  not  easy  to  go  there  and  back  from  it 
in  the  same  day.  He  appeared  particularly  pleased  with  this 
piece  of  information,  and  after  having  thanked  me  warmly, 
left  me,  with  an  absorbed,  delighted  look  on  his  face,  and  with- 
out having  once  recurred  either  to  George  or  to  Bernard.

BERNARD  AND  THE  ANGEL 

Bernard  was  to  experience  that  morning  that  for  a  nature  as 
generous  as  his,  there  is  no  greater  joy  than  to  rejoice  another 
being.  This  joy  was  denied  him.  He  had  just  heard  that  he  had 
passed  his  examination  with  honours,  but  finding  no  one  near 
to  whom  he  could  communicate  it,  the  news  lost  all  its  savour. 
Bernard  knew  well  enough  that  the  person  who  would  have  been 
most  pleased  to  hear  it,  was  his  father.  He  even  hesitated  a 
moment  whether  he  would  not  go  there  and  then  and  tell  him; 
but  pride  held  him  back.  Edouard?  Olivier?  It  was  really  giv- 
ing too  much  importance  to  a  certificate.  He  had  passed  his 
haccalanreat.  Nothing  to  make  a  fuss  about!  It  was  now  that 
the  difficulties  would  begin. 

In  the  Sorbonne  quadrangle,  he  saw  one  of  his  schoolfellows, 
who  had  also  been  successful;  but  he  had  drawn  apart  from  the 
others  and  was  crying.  The  poor  boy  was  in  mourning.  Bernard 
knew  that  he  had  just  lost  his  mother.  A  great  wave  of  sym- 
pathy drove  him  towards  the  orphan;  then  a  feeling  of  absurd 
shyness  made  him  pass  on.  The  other  boy,  who  had  seen  him 
come  up  and  then  go  by,  was  ashamed  of  his  tears;  he  esteemed 
Bernard  and  was  hurt  by  what  he  took  for  contempt. 

Bernard  went  into  the  Luxembourg  gardens.  He  sat  down  on 
a  bench  in  the  same  part  of  the  gardens  where  he  had  gone  to 
meet  Olivier  the  evening  he  had  sought  shelter  with  him.  The 
air  was  almost  warm  and  the  blue  sky  laughed  down  at  him 
through  the  branches  of  the  great  trees,  already  stripped  of 
their  leaves.  One  could  not  believe  that  winter  was  really  on  the 
way;  the  cooing  birds  themselves  were  deceived.  But  Bernard 
did  not  look  at  the  gardens;  he  saw  the  ocean  of  life  spread 
out  before  him.  People  say  there  are  paths  on  the  sea,  but  they 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  320 

are  not  traced  and  Bernard  did  not  know  which  one  was  his. 

He  had  been  meditating  for  some  moments,  when  he  saw 
coming  towards  him — gliding  on  so  light  a  foot  that  one  felt 
it  might  have  rested  on  the  waves — an  angel.  Bernard  had  never 
seen  any  angels,  but  he  had  not  a  moment's  doubt,  and  when 
the  angel  said:  "Come!"  he  rose  obediently  and  followed  him. 
He  was  not  more  astonished  than  he  would  have  been  in  a 
dream.  He  tried  to  remember  afterwards  if  the  angel  had  taken 
him  by  the  hand;  but  in  reality  they  did  not  touch  each  other 
and  even  kept  a  little  apart.  They  returned  together  to  the  quad- 
rangle where  Bernard  had  left  the  orphan,  firmly  resolved  to 
speak  to  him;  but  the  quadrangle  was  empty. 

Bernard  walked,  with  the  angel  by  his  side,  towards  the 
church  of  the  Sorbonne,  into  which  the  angel  passed  first — 
into  which  Bernard  had  never  been  before.  Other  angels  were 
going  to  and  fro  in  this  place;  but  Bernard  had  not  the  eyes 
that  were  needed  to  see  them.  An  unfamiliar  peace  enfolded  him. 
The  angel  went  up  to  the  high  altar,  and  Bernard,  when  he  saw 
him  kneel  down,  knelt  down  beside  him.  He  did  not  believe  in 
any  god,  so  that  he  could  not  pray,  but  his  heart  was  filled  with 
a  lover's  longing  for  dedication,  for  sacrifice;  he  offered  himself. 
His  emotion  was  so  confused  that  no  word  could  have  expressed 
it;  but  suddenly  the  organ's  song  arose. 

"You  offered  yourself  in  the  same  way  to  Laura,"  said  the 
angel;  and  Bernard  felt  the  tears  streaming  down  his  cheeks. 
"Come,  follow  me." 

As  the  angel  drew  him  along,  Bernard  almost  knocked  up 
against  one  of  his  old  schoolfellows,  who  had  also  just  passed  his 
viva  voce.  Bernard  considered  him  a  dunce  and  was  astonished 
that  he  had  got  through.  The  dunce  did  not  notice  Bernard,  who 
saw  him  slip  some  money  for  a  candle  into  the  beadle's  hand. 
Bernard  shrugged  his  shoulders  and  went  out. 

When  he  found  himself  in  the  street  again,  he  saw  that  the 
angel  had  left  him.  He  went  into  a  tobacco  shop — the  very 
same  in  Vk'hich  George,  a  week  before,  had  risked  his  first  false 
coin.  He  had  passed  a  great  many  more  since  then.  Bernard 
bought  a  packet  of  cigarettes  and  smoked.  Why  had  the  angel 


321  BERNARD  AND  THE  ANGEL 

gone?  Had  Bernard  and  he  then  nothing  to  say  to  each  other? 
.  .  .  Noon  struck.  Bernard  was  hungry.  Should  he  go  back  to 
the  pension?  Should  he  join  Olivier  and  share  with  him 
Edouard's  lunch?  ...  He  made  sure  that  he  had  enough  money 
in  his  pocket  and  went  into  a  restaurant.  As  he  was  finishing  his 
lunch,  a  soft  voice  murmured  in  his  ear: 

"The  time  has  come  to  do  your  accounts." 

Bernard  turned  his  head.  The  angel  was  again  beside  him. 

"You  will  have  to  make  up  your  mind,"  he  said.  "You  have 
been  living  at  haphazard.  Do  you  mean  to  let  chance  dispose  of 
your  life?  You  want  to  be  of  service — but  what  do  you  wish  to 
serve?  That  is  the  question." 

"Teach  me;  guide  me,"  said  Bernard. 

The  angel  led  Bernard  into  a  hall  full  of  people.  At  the 
bottom  of  the  hall  was  a  platform  and  on  the  platform  a  table 
covered  with  a  dark  red  cloth.  A  man,  who  was  still  young,  was 
seated  behind  the  table  and  was  speaking. 

"It  is  a  very  great  folly,"  he  was  saying,  "to  imagine  that 
there  is  anything  we  can  discover  What  have  we  that  we  have 
not  received?  It  is  the  duty  of  each  one  of  us  to  understand 
while  we  are  still  young,  that  we  derive  from  the  past,  that  we 
are  bound  to  this  past  by  every  kind  of  obligation,  and  that 
the  whole  of  our  future  is  marked  out  by  it." 

When  he  had  finished  developing  this  theme,  another  orator 
took  his  place;  he  began  by  approving  the  former  and  then 
raised  his  voice  against  the  presumption  of  the  man  who  thinks 
he  can  live  without  a  doctrine,  or  guide  himself  by  his  own 
lights. 

"A  doctrine  has  been  bequeathed  us,"  he  said.  "It  has  already 
traversed  many  centuries.  It  is  assuredly  the  best — the  only 
one.  The  duty  of  each  one  of  us  is  to  prove  this  truth.  It  has 
been  handed  down  to  us  by  our  masters.  It  is  our  country's  and 
every  time  she  repudiates  it,  she  has  to  pay  for  her  error  dearly. 
No  one  can  be  a  good  Frenchman  without  holding  it,  nor  suc- 
ceed in  anything  good  without  conforming  to  it." 

To  this  second  orator  succeeded  a  third,  who  thanked  the 
other  two  for  having  so  ably  traced  what  he  called  the  theory 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  322 

of  their  programme;  then  he  set  forth  that  this  programme 
consisted  in  nothing  less  than  the  regeneration  of  France,  which 
was  to  be  brought  about  by  the  united  efforts  of  each  single 
member  of  their  party.  He  himself,  he  declared,  was  a  man  of 
action;  he  affirmed  that  the  end  and  proof  of  every  theory  is 
in  its  practice,  and  that  the  duty  of  every  good  Frenchman  is 
to  be  a  combatant. 

"But,  alas!"  he  added,  "how  many  isolated  efforts  are  wasted! 
Our  country  would  be  far  greater,  our  activity  would  be  far 
more  wide-spread,  all  that  is  best  in  us  would  be  brought  for- 
ward, if  every  effort  were  co-ordinated,  if  every  act  contributed 
to  the  glory  of  law  and  order,  if  everyone  were  willing  to  serve 
in  the  ranks." 

And  while  he  was  speaking,  a  number  of  young  men  went 
round  the  audience,  distributing  printed  forms  of  member- 
ship, which  had  only  to  be  signed. 

"You  wanted  to  offer  yourself,"  said  the  angel  then.  "What 
are  you  waiting  for?" 

Bernard  took  one  of  the  papers  which  were  handed  him;  it 
began  with  these  words:  "I  solemnly  pledge  myself  to  .  ,  ."  He 
read  it,  then  looked  at  the  angel  and  saw  that  he  was  smiling; 
then  he  looked  at  the  meeting  and  recognized  among  the  young 
men  present,  the  schoolfellow  whom  he  had  seen  just  before 
in  the  church,  burning  a  candle  in  gratitude  for  having  passed 
his  examination;  and  suddenly,  further  on,  he  caught  sight  of 
his  eldest  brother,  whom  he  had  not  seen  since  he  had  left  home. 
Bernard  did  not  like  him  and  was  a  little  jealous  of  the  con- 
sideration with  which  their  father  seemed  to  treat  him.  He 
crumpled  the  paper  nervously  in  his  hand. 

"Do  you  think  I  ought  to  sign?" 

"Yes,"  said  the  angel,  "certainly — if  you  have  doubts  of 
yourself." 

"I  doubt  no  longer,"  said  Bernard,  flinging  the  paper  from 
him. 

In  the  mean  time  the  orator  was  still  speaking.  When  Ber- 
nard began  to  listen  to  him  again,  he  was  teaching  an  infallible 
method  for  never  making  a  mistake,  which  was  to  give  up  ever 


323  BERNARD  AND  THE  ANGEL 

forming  a  judgment  for  oneself  and  always  to  defer  to  the  judg- 
ments of  one's  superiors. 

"And  who  are  these  superiors?"  asked  Bernard;  and  suddenly 
a  great  indignation  seized  him. 

"If  you  went  on  to  the  platform,"  he  said  to  the  angel,  "and 
grappled  with  him,  you  would  be  sure  to  throw  him.  .  .  ." 

"It  is  with  you  I  will  wrestle.  This  evening.  Do  you 
agree  .  .  .  ?" 

"Yes,"  said  Bernard. 

They  went  out.  They  reached  the  boulevards.  The  crowds 
that  were  thronging  them  seemed  entirely  composed  of  rich 
people;  each  of  them  seemed  sure  of  himself,  indifferent  to  the 
others,  but  anxious. 

"Is  that  the  image  of  happiness?"  asked  Bernard,  who  felt  the 
tears  rising  in  his  heart. 

Then  the  angel  took  Bernard  into  the  poor  quarters  of  the 
town,  whose  wretchedness  Bernard  had  never  suspected.  Eve- 
ning was  falling.  They  wandered  for  a  long  time  among  tall, 
sordid  houses,  inhabited  by  disease,  prostitution,  shame,  crime 
and  hunger.  It  was  only  then  that  Bernard  took  the  angel's 
hand,  and  the  angel  turned  aside  to  weep. 

Bernard  did  not  dine  that  evening;  and  when  he  went  back 
to  the  pension  he  did  not  attempt  to  join  Sarah,  as  he  had  done 
the  other  evenings,  but  went  straight  upstairs  to  the  room  he 
shared  with  Boris. 

Boris  was  already  in  bed  but  not  asleep.  He  was  re-reading, 
by  the  light  of  his  candle,  the  letter  he  had  received  that  very 
morning  from  Bronja. 

"I  am  afraid,"  wrote  his  friend,  "that  I  shall  never  see  you 
again.  I  caught  cold  when  we  got  back  to  Poland.  I  have  a 
cough;  and  though  the  doctor  hides  it  from  me,  I  feel  I  cannot 
live  much  longer." 

When  he  heard  Bernard  coming  up,  Boris  hid  the  letter  under 
his  pillow,  and  blew  the  candle  out  hurriedly. 

Bernard  came  in  in  the  dark.  The  angel  was  with  him,  but, 
although  the  night  was  not  very  dark,  Boris  saw  only  Bernard. 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  324 

"Are  you  asleep?"  asked  Bernard  in  a  whisper.  And  as  Boris 
did  not  answer,  he  concluded  he  was  sleeping. 

"Then,  now,"  said  Bernard  to  the  angel,  "we'll  have  it  out." 

And  all  that  night,  until  the  breaking  of  the  day,  they 
wrestled. 

Boris  dimly  perceived  that  Bernard  was  struggling.  He 
thought  it  was  his  way  of  praying  and  took  care  not  to  disturb 
him.  And  yet  he  would  have  liked  to  speak  to  him,  for  his  un- 
happiness  was  very  great.  He  got  up  and  knelt  down  at  the  foot 
of  his  bed.  He  would  have  liked  to  pray,  but  he  could  only 
sob: 

"Oh,  Bronja!  You  who  can  see  angels,  you  who  were  to  have 
opened  my  eyes,  you  are  leaving  me!  Without  you,  Bronja, 
what  will  become  of  me?  What  will  become  of  me?" 

Bernard  and  the  angel  were  too  busy  to  hear  him.  They 
wrestled  together  till  daybreak.  The  angel  departed  without 
either  of  them  having  vanquished  the  other. 

When,  a  little  later,  Bernard  himself  left  the  room,  he  met 
Rachel  in  the  passage. 

"I  want  to  speak  to  you,"  she  said.  Her  voice  was  so  sad  that 
Bernard  understood  at  once  what  it  was  she  had  to  say  to  him. 
He  answered  nothing,  bowed  his  head,  and  in  his  great  pity  for 
Rachel  suddenly  began  to  hate  Sarah  and  to  loathe  the  pleasure 
he  took  with  her.

BERNARD   VISITS   EDOUARD 

About  ten  o'clock,  Bernard  turned  up  at  Edouard's  with  a  hand 
bag  which  was  sufficient  to  contain  the  few  clothes  and  books 
that  he  possessed.  He  had  taken  leave  of  Azais  and  of  Madame 
Vedel,  but  had  not  attempted  to  see  Sarah. 

Bernard  was  grave.  His  struggle  with  the  angel  had  matured 
him.  He  no  longer  resembled  the  careless  youth  who  had  stolen 
the  suit-case  and  who  thought  that  all  that  is  needed  in  this 
world  is  to  be  daring.  He  was  beginning  to  understand  that 
boldness  is  often  achieved  at  the  expense  of  other  people's  happi- 
ness. 

"I  have  come  to  ask  for  shelter,"  said  he  to  Edouard.  "Here 
I  am  again  without  a  roof." 

"Why  are  you  leaving  the  Vedels'?" 

"For  private  reasons  .  .  .  forgive  me  for  not  telling  you." 

Edouard  had  observed  Bernard  and  Sarah  on  the  evening  of 
the  dinner  enough  to  guess  at  the  meaning  of  this  silence. 

"All  right,"  he  said  smiling.  "The  couch  in  my  studio  is  at 
your  service.  But  I  must  first  tell  you  that  your  father  came 
to  see  me  yesterday."  And  he  repeated  the  part  of  their  con- 
versation which  he  thought  likely  to  touch  him.  "It  is  not  in 
my  house  that  you  ought  to  spend  the  night,  but  in  his.  He  is 
expecting  you." 

Bernard,  however,  kept  silent. 

"I  will  think  about  it,"  he  said  at  last.  "Allow  me  in  the  mean 
time  to  leave  my  things  here.  May  1  see  Olivier?" 

"The  weather  is  so  fine,  that  I  advised  him  to  go  out.  I  wanted 
to  go  with  him,  for  he  is  still  very  weak,  but  he  wouldn't  let 
me.  But  it's  more  than  an  hour  since  he  left  and  he  will  be  back 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  326 

soon.  You  had  better  wait  for  him.  .  .  .  But  I've  just  thought. 
,  .  .  Your  examination?" 

"I've  passed;  but  it's  of  no  importance;  the  important  thing 
is  to  know  what  I'm  to  do  now.  Do  you  know  the  chief  reason 
that  prevents  me  from  going  back  to  my  father's?  It's  because 
I  don't  want  to  take  his  money.  You'll  think  me  absurd  to 
fling  away  such  an  opportunity;  but  I  made  a  vow  that  I  would 
make  my  way  without  it.  I  feel  I  must  prove  to  myself  that  I 
am  a  man  of  my  word — someone  I  can  count  on." 

"It  strikes  me  as  pride  more  than  anything  else." 

"Call  it  by  any  name  you  please — pride,  presumption,  con- 
ceit .  .  .  it's  a  feeling  you  won't  succeed  in  cheapening  in  my 
eyes.  But  at  the  present  moment,  what  I  should  like  to  know  is 
this — is  it  necessary  to  fix  one's  eyes  on  a  goal  in  order  to  guide 
oneself  in  life?" 

"Explain." 

"I  wrestled  over  it  all  last  night.  What  am  I  to  do  with  the 
strength  I  feel  I  possess?  To  what  use  am  I  to  put  it?  How  am 
I  to  get  out  of  myself  the  best  that's  in  me?  Is  it  by  aiming  at 
a  goal?  But  how  choose  such  a  goal?  How  know  what  it  is 
before  reaching  it?" 

"To  live  without  a  goal,  is  to  give  oneself  up  to  chance." 

"I  am  afraid  you  don't  understand.  When  Columbus  discov- 
ered America  did  he  know  towards  what  he  was  sailing?  His 
goal  was  to  go  ahead,  straight  in  front  of  him.  Himself  was  his 
goal,  impelling  him  to  go  ahead.  .  .  ." 

"I  have  often  thought,"  interrupted  Edouard,  "that  in  art, 
and  particularly  in  literature,  the  only  people  who  count  are 
those  who  launch  out  on  to  unknown  seas.  One  doesn't  discover 
new  lands  without  consenting  to  lose  sight  of  the  shore  for 
a  very  long  time.  But  our  writers  are  afraid  of  the  open;  they 
are  mere  coasters." 

"Yesterday,  when  I  came  out  from  my  examination,"  Ber- 
nard said,  without  hearing  him,  "some  demon  or  other  urged 
me  into  a  hall  where  there  was  a  public  meeting  going  on.  The 
talk  was  all  about  national  honour,  devotion  to  one's  country, 
and  a  whole  lot  of  things  that  made  my  heart  beat.  I  came 


327  BERNARD  VISITS   EDOUARD 

within  an  ace  of  signing  a  paper  by  which  I  pledged  myself  on 
my  honour  to  devote  my  energies  to  the  service  of  a  cause, 
which  certainly  seemed  to  me  a  fine  and  noble  one." 

"I  am  glad  you  didn't  sign,  but  what  prevented  you?" 

"No  doubt  some  secret  instinct.  .  .  ."  Bernard  reflected  a  few 
moments,  and  then  added,  laughing:  "I  think  it  was  chiefly  the 
looks  of  the  audience — starting  with  my  brother,  whom  I  recog- 
nized among  them.  It  seemed  to  me  all  the  young  men  I  saw 
there,  were  animated  by  the  best  of  sentiments,  and  that  they 
were  doing  quite  right  to  abdicate  their  initiative  (for  it 
wouldn't  have  led  them  far)  and  their  judgment  (for  it  was 
inadequate)  and  their  independence  of  mind  (for  it  was  still- 
born). I  said  to  myself  too,  that  it  was  a  good  thing  for  the 
country  to  count  among  its  citizens  a  large  number  of  these 
well-intentioned  individuals  with  subservient  wills,  but  that  my 
will  would  never  be  of  that  kind.  It  was  then  that  I  began  to 
ask  myself  how  to  establish  a  rule,  since  I  did  not  accept  life 
without  a  rule  and  yet  would  not  accept  a  rule  from  anyone 
else." 

"The  answer  seems  to  me  simple:  to  find  the  rule  in  oneself; 
to  have  for  goal  the  development  of  oneself." 

"Yes  ,  .  .  that,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  is  what  I  said  to  myself. 
But  I  wasn't  much  further  on.  If  I  were  certain  of  preferring 
what  is  best  in  myself,  I  might  develop  that  rather  than  the  rest. 
But  I  can't  even  find  out  what  is  best  in  myself.  ...  I  wrestled 
over  it  all  night,  I  tell  you.  Towards  morning  I  was  so  tired  that 
I  thought  of  enlisting — before  I  was  called  up." 

"Running  away  from  the  question  doesn't  solve  it." 

"That's  what  I  said  to  myself,  and  that  even  if  I  put  the  ques- 
tion off  now,  it  would  come  up  again  more  seriously  than  ever 
after  my  service.  So  I  came  to  ask  you  your  advice." 

"I  have  none  to  give  you.  You  can  only  find  counsel  in  your- 
self; you  can  only  learn  how  you  ought  to  live  by  living." 

"And  if  I  live  badly,  whilst  I'm  waiting  to  decide  how  to 
live?" 

"That  in  itself  will  teach  you.  It's  a  good  thing  to  follow  one's 
inclination,  provided  it  leads  up  hill." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  328 

"Are  you  joking?  .  .  .  No;  I  think  I  understand  you,  and  I 
accept  your  formula.  But  while  I  am  developing  myself,  as  you 
say,  I  shall  have  to  earn  my  living.  What  do  you  say  to  an 
alluring  advertisement  in  the  papers:  "Young  man  of  great 
promise  requires  a  job.  Could  be  employed  in  any  capacity?" 

Edouard  laughed. 

"No  job  is  so  difficult  to  find  as  any  job.  Better  be  a  little 
more  explicit." 

"Perhaps  one  of  the  innumerable  little  wheels  in  the  organiza- 
tion of  a  big  newspaper  would  do?  Oh!  I'd  accept  any  post 
however  subordinate — proof-reader — printer's  devil — anything. 
I  need  so  little." 

He  spoke  with  hesitation.  In  reality,  it  was  a  secretaryship  he 
wanted;  but  he  did  not  dare  say  so  to  Edouard,  because  of  their 
mutual  dissatisfaction  with  each  other  on  this  score.  After  all, 
it  wasn't  his,  Bernard's,  fault,  that  this  trial  of  theirs  had  failed 
so  lamentably. 

"I  might  perhaps,"  said  Edouard,  "get  you  into  the  Grand 
Journal;  I  know  the  editor.  .  .  ." 

While  Bernard  and  Edouard  were  conversing  in  this  manner, 
Sarah  was  having  an  extremely  painful  explanation  with  Rachel. 
Sarah  had  suddenly  understood  that  Rachel's  remonstrances 
were  the  cause  of  Bernard's  abrupt  departure;  and  she  was  in- 
dignant with  her  sister,  who,  she  said,  was  a  kill-joy.  She  had  no 
right  to  impose  upon  others  a  virtue  which  her  example  was 
enough  to  render  odious. 

Rachel,  who  was  terribly  upset  by  these  accusations,  for  she 
had  always  sacrificed  herself,  turned  very  white,  and  protested 
with  trembling  lips: 

"I  can't  let  you  go  to  perdition." 

But  Sarah  sobbed  and  cried  out: 

"I  don't  believe  in  your  heaven.  I  don't  want  to  be  saved." 

She  decided  on  the  spot  to  return  to  England,  where  she  would 
go  and  stay  with  her  friend.  For,  after  all,  she  was  free  and 
claimed  the  right  to  live  in  any  way  she  pleased.  This  melan- 
choly quarrel  left  Rachel  shattered.

EDOUARD  WARNS  GEORGE 

Edouard  took  care  to  arrive  at  the  pension  before  the  boys  came 
in.  He  had  not  seen  La  Perouse  since  the  beginning  of  the  term 
and  it  was  to  him  that  he  wanted  to  speak  first.  The  old  music 
master  carried  out  his  new  duties  as  well  as  he  could — that  is 
to  say,  very  badly.  He  had  at  first  tried  to  make  himself  liked, 
but  he  had  no  authority;  the  boys  took  advantage  of  him;  his 
indulgence  passed  for  weakness,  and  they  began  to  take  strange 
liberties.  La  Perouse  tried  to  be  severe,  but  too  late;  his  exhorta- 
tions, his  threats,  his  reprimands  finally  set  the  boys  against 
him.  If  he  raised  his  voice,  they  laughed;  if  he  thumped  his 
fist  resoundingly  on  his  desk,  they  shrieked  in  pretended  ter- 
ror; they  mimicked  him;  they  called  him  by  absurd  nick- 
names; caricatures  of  him  circulated  from  bench  to  bench;  he — 
so  kind  and  courteous — was  portrayed  armed  with  a  pistol  (the 
pistol  which  Gheridanisol,  George  and  Phiphi  had  found  one 
day  in  the  course  of  an  indiscreet  investigation  of  his  room), 
ferociously  massacring  the  boys;  or  else  on  his  knees  before 
them,  with  hands  clasped,  imploring,  as  he  had  done  at  first, 
for  "a  little  quiet,  for  pity's  sake."  He  was  like  a  poor  old  stag 
at  bay  among  a  savage  pack  of  hounds.  Edouard  knew  nothing 
of  all  this. 

EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL 

La  Perouse  received  me  in  a  small  class-room  on  the  ground 
floor,  which  I  recognized  as  the  most  uncomfortable  one  in  the 
school.  Its  only  furniture  consisted  of  four  benches  attached  to 
four  desks,  a  blackboard  and  a  straw  chair,  on  which  La 
Perouse  forced  me  to  sit  down,  while  he  screwed  himself  up 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  330 

slantwise  on  to  one  of  the  benches,  after  vain  endeavours  to  get 
his  long  legs  under  the  desk. 

"No,  no.  I'm  perfectly  comfortable,  I  assure  you,"  he  de- 
clared, while  the  tone  of  his  voice  and  the  expression  of  his 
face  said : 

"I  am  horribly  uncomfortable,  and  I  hope  it's  obvious;  but 
I  prefer  to  be  so;  and  the  more  uncomfortable  I  am,  the  less  you 
will  hear  me  complain." 

I  tried  to  make  a  joke,  but  could  not  succeed  in  getting  him 
to  smile.  His  manner  was  ceremonious  and  stiff,  as  if  he  wished 
to  keep  me  at  a  distance  and  imply:  "I  owe  it  to  you  that  I  am 
here." 

At  the  same  time  he  declared  himself  perfectly  satisfied  with 
everything,  though  all  the  while  eluding  my  questions  and  seem- 
ing vexed  at  my  insisting.  1  asked  him,  however,  where  his 
room  was. 

"Rather  too  far  from  the  kitchen,"  he  suddenly  exclaimed; 
and  as  I  expressed  my  astonishment:  "Sometimes  during  the 
night,  I  want  something  to  eat  .  .  .  when  1  can't  sleep." 

I  was  near  him;  I  came  nearer  still  and  put  my  hand  gently 
on  his  arm.  He  went  on  in  a  more  natural  tone: 

"I  must  tell  you  that  I  sleep  very  badly.  When  I  do  go  to 
sleep,  1  never  lose  the  feeling  that  I  am  asleep.  That's  not  proper 
sleep,  is  it?  A  person  who  is  properly  asleep,  doesn't  feel  that  he 
is  alseep.  When  he  wakes  up,  he  just  knows  that  he  has  been 
asleep." 

Then,  leaning  towards  me,  he  went  on  with  a  kind  of  finicky 
insistence: 

"Sometimes  I'm  inclined  to  think  that  it's  an  illusion  and 
that,  all  the  same,  1  am  properly  asleep,  when  I  think  I'm  not 
asleep.  But  the  proof  that  I'm  not  properly  asleep  is  that  if  I 
want  to  open  my  eyes,  1  open  them.  As  a  rule,  1  don't  want  to. 
You  understand,  don't  you,  that  there's  no  object  in  it?  What's 
the  use  of  proving  to  myself  that  I'm  not  asleep?  I  always  go 
on  hoping  that  I  shall  go  to  sleep  by  persuading  myself  that 
I'm  asleep  already.  .  .  ." 

He  bent  still  nearer  and  went  on  in  a  whisper: 


331  EDOUARD  WARNS  GEORGE 

"And  then  there's  something  that  disturbs  me.  Don't  tell  any- 
one. ...  I  haven't  complained,  because  there's  nothing  to  do 
about  it;  and  if  a  thing  can't  be  altered,  there's  no  good  com- 
plaining, is  there?  .  .  .  Well,  just  imagine,  in  the  wall,  right 
against  my  bed  and  exactly  on  a  level  with  my  head,  there's 
something  that  makes  a  noise." 

He  had  grown  excited  as  he  spoke.  I  suggested  that  he  should 
take  me  to  his  room. 

"Yes!  Yes!"  he  said  getting  up  suddenly.  "You  might  be  able 
to  tell  me  what  it  is  ...  I  can't  succeed  in  making  out.  Come 
along." 

We  went  up  two  stories  and  then  down  a  longish  passage.  I 
had  never  been  into  that  part  of  the  house  before. 

La  Perouse's  room  looked  on  to  the  street.  It  was  small  but 
decent.  On  the  bedside  table,  I  noticed,  next  a  prayer  book, 
the  case  of  pistols,  which  he  had  insisted  on  taking  with  him. 
He  seized  me  by  the  arm,  and  pushing  aside  the  bed  a  little: 

"There!  Now!  .  .  .  Put  your  ear  to  the  wall.  .  .  .  Can  you 
hear  it?" 

I  listened  for  a  long  time  with  the  greatest  attention.  But  not- 
withstanding the  best  will  in  the  world,  I  could  not  succeed  in 
hearing  anything.  La  Perouse  grew  vexed.  Just  then  a  van 
drove  by,  shaking  the  house  and  making  the  windows  rattle. 

"At  this  time  of  day,"  I  said,  in  the  hopes  of  pacifying  him, 
the  little  noise  that  irritates  you  is  drowned  by  the  noise  of  the 
street.  .  .  ." 

"Drowned  for  you,  because  you  can't  distinguish  it  from  the 
other  noises,"  he  exclaimed  with  vehemence.  "As  for  me,  I  hear 
it  all  the  same.  In  spite  of  everything,  I  go  on  hearing  it.  Some- 
times I  am  so  exasperated  by  it  that  I  make  up  my  mind  to 
speak  to  Azais  or  to  the  landlord.  ...  Oh,  I  don't  suppose  I 
shall  get  it  to  stop.  .  .  .  But,  at  any  rate,  I  should  like  to  know 
what  it  is." 

He  seemed  to  reflect  for  a  few  moments,  then  went  on:  "It 
sounds  something  like  a  nibbling.  I've  done  everything  I  can 
think  of  not  to  hear  it.  I  pull  my  bed  away  from  the  wall.  I 
put  cotton  wool  in  my  ears.  I  hang  my  watch  (you  see,  I've  put 


THE   COUNTERFEITERS  332 

a  little  nail  there)  just  at  the  place  where  the  pipe  (I  suppose) 
passes,  so  that  its  ticking  may  prevent  my  hearing  the  other 
noise.  .  .  .  But  then  it's  even  more  fatiguing,  because  I  have 
to  make  an  effort  to  distinguish  it.  Absurd,  isn't  it?  But  I  really 
prefer  to  hear  it  without  any  disguise,  since  I  know  it's  there 
all  the  same.  ...  Oh!  I  oughtn't  to  talk  to  you  in  this  way. 
You  see,  I'm  nothing  but  an  old  man  now." 

He  sat  down  on  the  edge  of  the  bed,  and  stayed  for  some  time, 
as  though  sunk  in  a  kind  of  dull  misery.  The  sinister  degrada- 
tion of  age  is  not  so  much  attacking  La  Perouse's  intelligence 
as  the  innermost  depths  of  his  nature.  The  worm  lodges  itself 
in  the  fruit's  core,  I  thought,  as  I  saw  him  give  way  to  his  child- 
ish despair,  and  remembered  him  as  he  used  to  be,  so  firm — so 
proud.  I  tried  to  rouse  him  by  speaking  of  Boris. 

"Yes,  his  room  is  near  mine,"  said  he,  raising  his  head.  "I'll 
show  it  to  you.  Come  along." 

He  preceded  me  along  the  passage  and  opened  a  neighbouring 
door. 

"The  other  bed  you  see  there  is  young  Bernard  Profiten- 
dieu's."  (I  judged  it  useless  to  tell  him  that  Bernard  had  left 
that  very  day,  and  would  not  be  coming  back  to  sleep  in  it.)  He 
went  on:  "Boris  likes  having  him  as  a  companion  and  I  think  he 
gets  on  with  him.  But,  you  know,  he  doesn't  talk  to  me  much. 
He's  very  reserved,  ...  I  am  afraid  the  child  is  rather  un- 
feeling." 

He  said  this  so  sadly  that  I  took  upon  myself  to  protest  and 
to  say  that  I  could  answer  for  his  grandson's  warmheartedness. 

"In  that  case,  he  might  show  it  a  little  more,"  went  on  La 
Perouse. 

"For  instance,  in  the  mornings,  when  he  goes  off  to  the  lycee 
with  the  others,  I  lean  out  of  my  window  to  see  him  go  by.  He 
knows  I  do.  .  .  .  Well,  he  never  turns  round." 

I  wanted  to  explain  to  him  that  no  doubt  Boris  was  afraid  of 
making  a  spectacle  of  himself  before  his  schoolfellows  and 
dreaded  being  laughed  at;  but  at  that  moment  a  clamour  arose 
from  the  courtyard  below. 


333  EDOUARD  WARNS   GEORGE 

La  Perouse  seized  me  by  the  arm  and,  in  an  altered,  agitated 
voice : 

"Listen!  Listen!"  he  cried,  "they  are  coming  in." 

I  looked  at  him.  He  had  begun  to  tremble  all  over. 

"Do  the  little  wretches  frighten  you?"  I  asked. 

"No,  no,"  he  said  in  some  confusion;  "how  could  you  think 
such  a  thing?  .  .  ."  Then,  very  quickly:  "1  must  go  down. 
Recreation  only  lasts  a  few  minutes  and  you  know  I  take  prep- 
aration. Good-bye.  Good-bye." 

He  darted  into  the  passage,  without  even  shaking  my  hand. 
A  moment  later  I  heard  him  stumbling  downstairs.  I  stayed  for 
a  few  moments  to  listen,  as  I  had  no  wish  to  go  past  the  boys.  I 
could  hear  them  shouting,  laughing  and  singing.  Then  a  bell 
rang  and  silence  was  abruptly  restored. 

I  went  to  see  Azais  and  obtained  permission  for  George  to 
leave  school  in  order  to  come  and  speak  to  me.  He  soon  joined 
me  in  the  same  small  room  in  which  La  Perouse  had  received  me 
a  little  while  before. 


As  soon  as  he  was  in  my  presence,  George  thought  fit  to  as- 
sume a  jocular  air.  It  was  his  way  of  concealing  his  embarrass- 
ment. But  I  wouldn't  swear  that  he  was  the  more  embarrassed 
of  the  two.  He  was  on  the  defensive;  for  no  doubt  he  expected 
to  be  sermonized.  He  seemed  trying  as  hastily  as  possible  to  lay 
hold  of  anything  he  could  use  as  a  weapon  against  me,  for,  be- 
fore I  had  opened  my  mouth,  he  enquired  after  Olivier,  in  such 
a  bantering  tone  of  voice,  that  I  should  have  had  the  greatest 
pleasure  in  boxing  his  ears.  He  was  in  a  position  to  score  off 
me.  His  ironical  eyes,  the  mocking  curl  of  his  lips  all  seemed  to 
say:  "I'm  not  afraid  of  you,  you  know."  I  at  once  lost  all  my 
self-assurance  and  my  one  anxiety  was  to  conceal  the  fact.  The 
speech  I  had  prepared  suddenly  struck  me  as  inappropriate.  I 
had  not  the  prestige  necessary  to  play  the  censor.  At  bottom, 
George  amused  me  too  much. 

"I  have  not  come  to  scold  you,"  I  said  at  last;  "I  only  want 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  334 

to  warn  you."  (And,  in  spite  of  myself,  my  whole  face  was 
smiling.) 
"Tell  me  first  whether  it's  Mamma  who  has  sent  you?" 
"Yes  and  no.  I  have  spoken  about  you  to  your  mother;  but 
that  was  some  days  ago.  Yesterday  I  had  a  very  important  con- 
versation about  you  with  a  very  important  person,  whom  you 
don't  know.  He  came  to  see  me  on  purpose  to  talk  about  you. 
A  juge  d' instruction.  It's  from  him  I've  come.  Do  you  know 
what  a  juge  d' instruction  is?" 

George  had  turned  suddenly  pale,  and  no  doubt  his  heart  had 
stopped  beating  for  a  moment.  He  shrugged  his  shoulders,  it  is 
true,  but  his  voice  trembled  a  little : 
"Oh!  all  right!  Out  with  it!  What  did  old  Profitendieu  say?" 
The  youngster's  coolness  took  me  aback.  No  doubt  it  would 
have  been  simpler  to  go  straight  to  the  point;  but  going  straight 
to  the  point  is  a  thing  particularly  foreign  to  my  nature,  whose 
irresistible  bent  is  towards  moving  obliquely.  In  order  to  ex- 
plain my  conduct,  which,  though  it  afterwards  appeared  absurd 
to  me,  was  quite  spontaneous  at  the  time,  I  must  say  that  my 
last  conversation  with  Pauline  had  greatly  exercised  me.  I  had 
immediately  inserted  the  reflections  it  had  suggested  to  me  into 
my  novel,  putting  them  into  the  form  of  a  dialogue,  which  ex- 
actly fitted  in  with  certain  of  my  characters.  It  very  rarely  hap- 
pens that  I  make  direct  use  of  what  occurs  to  me  in  real  life,  but 
for  once  I  was  able  to  take  advantage  of  this  affair  of  George's; 
it  was  as  though  my  book  had  been  waiting  for  it,  it  came  in  so 
pat;  I  hardly  had  to  alter  one  or  two  details. 

But  I  did  not  give  a  direct  account  of  this  affair  (I  mean 
his  stealing).  I  merely  showed  it — with  its  consequences — by 
glimpses,  in  the  course  of  conversations.  I  had  put  down  some 
of  these  in  a  note-book,  which  I  had  at  that  very  moment  in 
my  pocket.  On  the  contrary,  the  story  of  the  false  coins,  as  re- 
lated by  Profitendieu,  did  not  seem  to  me  capable  of  being 
turned  to  account.  And  no  doubt  that  is  why,  instead  of  making 
immediately  for  this  particular  point,  which  was  the  main 
object  of  my  visit,  I  tacked  about. 


335  EDOUARD  WARNS  GEORGE 

"I  first  want  you  to  read  these  few  lines,"  I  said.  "You  will 
see  why."  And  I  held  him  out  my  note-book,  which  I  had 
opened  at  the  page  I  thought  might  interest  him. 

I  repeat  it — this  behaviour  of  mine  now  seems  to  me  absurd. 
But  in  my  novel,  it  is  precisely  by  a  similar  reading  that  I 
thought  of  giving  the  youngest  of  my  heroes  a  warning.  I  wanted 
to  know  what  George's  reaction  would  be;  I  hoped  it  might  in- 
struct me  .  .  .  and  even  as  to  the  value  of  what  I  had 
written. 

I  transcribe  the  passage  in  question : 

There  was  a  whole  obscure  region  in  the  boy's  character 
which  attracted  Audibert's  affectionate  curiosity.  It  was  not 
enough  for  him  to  know  that  young  Eudolfe  had  committed 
thefts;  he  would  have  liked  Eudolfe  to  tell  him  what  had  made 
him  begin,  and  what  he  had  felt  on  the  occasion  of  his  first 
theft.  But  the  boy,  even  if  he  had  been  willing  to  confide  in 
him,  would  no  doubt  have  been  incapable  of  explaining.  And 
Audibert  did  not  dare  question  him,  for  fear  of  inducing  him 
to  tell  lies  in  self-defence. 

One  evening  when  Audibert  was  dining  with  Hildebrant,  he 
spoke  to  him  about  Eudolfe — without  naming  him  and  alter- 
ing the  circumstances  so  that  Hildebrant  should  not  lecognize 
him. 

"Have  you  ever  observed,"  said  Hildebrant,  "that  the  most 
decisive  actions  of  our  life — I  mean  those  that  are  most  likely 
to  decide  the  whole  course  of  our  future — are,  more  often  than 
not,  unconsidered?" 

"I  easily  believe  it,"  replied  Audibert.  "Like  a  train  into 
which  one  jumps  without  thinking,  and  without  asking  oneself 
where  it  is  going.  And  more  often  than  not,  one  does  not 
even  realize  that  the  train  is  carrying  one  off',  till  it  is  too  late 
to  get  down." 

"But  perhaps  the  boy  you  are  talking  of  has  no  wish  to 
get  down?" 

"Not  so  far,  doubtless.  For  the  moment  he  is  being  carried 
along  unresisting.  The  scenery  amuses  him,  and  he  cares  very 
little  where  he  is  going." 

"Do  you  mean  to  talk  morals  to  him?" 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  336 

"No  indeed!  It  would  be  useless.  He  has  been  overdosed 
with  morals  till  he  is  sick." 

"Why  did  he  steal?" 

"I  don't  exactly  know.  Certainly  not  from  real  need.  But 
to  get  certain  advantages — not  to  be  outdone  by  his  wealthier 
companions — Heaven  knows  what  all!  Innate  propensity — sheer 
pleasure  of  stealing." 

"That's  the  worst." 

"Of  course!  Because  he'll  begin  again." 

"Is  he  intelligent?" 

"I  thought  for  a  long  time  that  he  was  less  so  than  his  broth- 
ers. But  1  wonder  now  whether  I  wasn't  mistaken,  and  whether 
my  unfavourable  impression  was  not  caused  by  the  fact  that 
he  does  not  as  yet  understand  what  his  capabilities  are.  His  cu- 
riosity has  gone  off  the  tracks — or  rather,  it  is  still  in  the  em- 
bryonic state — still  at  the  stage  of  indiscretion." 

"Will  you  speak  to  him?" 

"I  propose  making  him  put  in  the  scales,  on  the  one  hand 
the  little  profit  his  thefts  bring  him,  and  on  the  other  what 
his  dishonesty  loses  him:  the  confidence  of  his  friends  and 
relations,  their  esteem,  mine  amongst  others  .  .  .  things  which 
can't  be  measured  and  the  value  of  which  can  be  calculated 
only  by  the  enormousness  of  the  effort  needed  later  to  regain 
them.  There  are  men  who  have  spent  their  whole  lives  over 
it.  I  shall  tell  him,  v/hat  he  is  still  too  young  to  realize — that 
henceforth  if  anything  doubtful  or  unpleasant  happens  in  his 
neighbourhood,  it  will  always  be  laid  to  his  door.  He  may  find 
himself  accused  wrongfully  of  serious  misdeeds  and  be  unable 
to  defend  himself.  His  past  actions  point  to  him.  He  is  marked. 
And  lastly  what  I  should  like  to  say  .  .  .  But  I  am  afraid 
of  his  protestations." 

"You  would  like  to  say?  .  .  ." 

"That  what  he  has  done  has  created  a  precedent,  and  that 
if  some  resolution  is  required  for  a  first  theft,  for  the  ensuing 
ones  nothing  is  needed  but  to  drift  with  the  current.  All  that 
follows  is  mere  laisser  aller.  .  .  .  What  1  should  like  to  say  is, 
that  a  first  movement,  which  one  makes  almost  without  think- 
ing, often  begins  to  trace  a  line  which  irrevocably  draws  our 
figure,  and  which  our  after  effort  will  never  be  able  to  efface. 
I  should  like  .  .  .  but  no,  I  shan't  know  how  to  speak  to  him." 


337  EDOUARD  WARNS  GEORGE 

"Why  don't  you  write  down  our  conversation  of  this  eve- 
ning? You  could  give  it  him  to  read." 

"That's  an  idea,"  said  Audibert.  "Why  not?" 


I  did  not  take  my  eyes  off  George  while  he  was  reading;  but 
his  face  showed  no  signs  of  what  he  was  thinking. 

"Am  I  to  go  on?"  he  asked,  preparing  to  turn  the  page. 

"There's  no  need.  The  conversation  ends  there." 

"A  great  pity." 

He  gave  me  back  the  note-book,  and  in  a  tone  of  voice  that 
was  almost  playful: 

"I  should  have  liked  to  know  what  Eudolfe  says  when  he  has 
read  the  note-book." 

"Exactly.  I  want  to  know  myself." 

"Eudolfe  is  a  ridiculous  name.  Couldn't  you  have  christened 
him  something  else?" 

"It's  of  no  importance." 

"Nor  what  he  answers  either.  And  what  becomes  of  him 
afterwards?" 

"I  don't  know  yet.  It  depends  upon  you.  We  shall  see." 

"Then  if  I  understand  right,  /  am  to  help  you  go  on  with  your 
book.  No,  really,  you  must  admit  that  .  .  ." 

He  stopped  as  if  he  had  some  difficulty  in  expressing  his  ideas. 

"That  what?"  I  said  to  encourage  him. 

"You  must  admit  that  you'd  be  pretty  well  sold,"  he  went  on, 
"if  Eudolfe  .  .  ." 

He  stopped  again.  I  thought  I  understood  what  he  meant  and 
finished  his  sentence  for  him: 

"If  he  became  an  honest  boy?  .  .  .  No,  my  dear."  And  sud- 
denly the  tears  rose  to  my  eyes.  I  put  my  hand  on  his  shoulder. 
But  he  shook  it  off: 

"For  after  all,  if  he  hadn't  been  a  thief,  you  wouldn't  have 
written  all  that." 

It  was  only  then  that  I  understood  my  mistake.  In  reality, 
George  was  flattered  at  having  occupied  my  thoughts  for  so 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  338 

long.  He  felt  interesting.  I  had  forgotten  Profitendieu ;  it  was 
George  who  reminded  me  of  him. 

"And  what  did  your  juge  d' instruction  say  to  you?" 

"He  commissioned  me  to  warn  you  that  he  knew  you  were 
circulating  false  coins.  .  .  ." 

George  changed  colour  again.  He  understood  denials  would 
be  useless,  but  he  muttered  indistinctly: 

"I'm  not  the  only  one." 

".  .  .  and  that  if  you  and  your  pals  don't  stop  your  traf- 
fickings  at  once,  he'll  be  obliged  to  arrest  you." 

George  had  begun  by  turning  very  pale  .Now  his  cheeks  were 
burning.  He  stared  fixedly  in  front  of  him  and  his  knitted  brows 
drew  two  deep  wrinkles  on  his  forehead. 

"Good-bye,"  I  said,  holding  out  my  hand.  "I  advise  you  to 
warn  your  companions  as  well.  As  for  you,  you  won't  be  offered 
a  second  chance." 

He  shook  my  hand  silently  and  left  the  room  without  looking 
round. 

On  re-reading  the  pages  of  The  Counterfeiters  which  I  showed 
George,  I  thought  them  on  the  whole  rather  bad.  I  transcribe 
them  as  George  read  them,  but  all  this  chapter  must  be  re- 
written. It  would  be  better  decidedly  to  speak  to  the  child.  I 
must  discover  how  to  touch  him.  Certainly,  at  the  point  he  has 
reached,  it  would  be  difficult  to  bring  Eudolfe  (George  is  right; 
I  must  change  his  name)  back  into  the  path  of  honesty.  But  I 
mean  to  bring  him  back;  and  whatever  George  may  think,  this 
is  what  is  most  interesting,  because  it  is  most  difficult.  (Here  am 
I  reasoning  like  Douviers!)  Let  us  leave  realistic  novelists  to 
deal  with  the  stories  of  those  who  drift. 

As  soon  as  he  got  back  to  the  class-room,  George  told  his  two 
friends  of  Edouard's  warnings.  Everything  his  uncle  had  said 
about  his  pilferings  slipped  off  the  child's  mind,  without  caus- 
ing him  the  slightest  emotion;  but,  when  it  came  to  the  false 
coins,  which  ran  the  risk  of  getting  them  into  trouble,  he  saw 
the  importance  of  getting  rid  of  them  as  quickly  as  possible. 


339  EDOUARD  WARNS  GEORGE 

Each  of  the  three  boys  had  on  him  a  certain  number  which  he 
intended  disposing  of  the  next  free  afternoon.  Gheridanisol  col- 
lected them  and  hurried  off  to  throw  them  down  the  drains. 
That  same  evening  he  warned  Strouvilhou,  who  immediately 
took  his  precautions. 


XVII 

ARMAND   AND  OLIVIER 

That  same  evening,  while  Edouard  was  talking  to  his  nephew 
George,  Olivier,  after  Bernard  had  left  him,  received  a  visit 
from  Armand. 

Armand  Vedel  was  unrecognizable;  shaved,  smiling,  carry- 
ing his  head  high;  he  was  dressed  in  a  new  suit,  which  was 
rather  too  smart  and  looked  perhaps  a  trifle  ridiculous;  he  felt 
it  and  showed  that  he  felt  it. 

"I  should  have  come  to  see  you  before,  but  I've  had  so  much 
to  do  lately!  ...  Do  you  know  that  I've  actually  become  Pas- 
savant's  secretary?  or,  if  you  prefer  it,  the  editor  of  his  new 
review.  I  won't  ask  you  to  contribute,  because  Passavant  seems 
rather  worked  up  against  you.  Besides  the  review  is  decidedly 
going  more  and  more  to  the  left.  That's  the  reason  it  has  begun 
by  dropping  Bercail  and  his  pastorals.  .  .  ." 

"I'm  sorry  for  the  review,"  said  Olivier. 

"And  that's  why,  on  the  other  hand,  it  has  accepted  my 
Nocturnal  Vase,  which,  by  the  bye,  is,  without  your  permission, 
to  be  dedicated  to  you." 

"I'm  sorry  for  me." 

"Passavant  even  wished  my  work  of  genius  to  open  the  first 
number;  but  my  natural  modesty,  which  was  severely  tried  by 
his  encomiums,  was  opposed  to  this.  If  I  were  not  afraid  of 
fatiguing  a  convalescent's  ears,  I  would  give  you  an  account  of 
my  first  interview  with  the  illustrious  author  of  The  Horizontal 
Bar,  whom  I  had  only  known  up  till  then  through  you." 

"I  have  nothing  better  to  do  than  to  listen." 

"You  don't  mind  smoke?" 

"I'll  smoke  myself  to  show  you." 

"I  must  tell  you,"  began  Armand,  lighting  a  cigarette,  "that 


341  ARMAND   AND  OLIVIER 

your  desertion  left  our  beloved  Count  somewhat  in  a  fix.  Let 
it  be  said,  without  flattery,  that  it  isn't  easy  to  replace  such  a 
bundle  of  gifts,  virtues,  qualities  as  are  united  in  your  .  .  ." 

"Get  on,"  interrupted  Olivier,  exasperated  by  this  heavy- 
footed  irony. 

"Well,  to  get  on,  Passavant  wanted  a  secretary.  He  happened 
to  know  a  certain  Strouvilhou,  whom  I  happen  to  know  myself, 
because  he  is  the  uncle  of  a  certain  individual  in  the  school,  who 
happened  to  know  Jean  Cob-Lafleur,  whom  you  know." 

"Whom  I  don't  know,"  said  Olivier. 

"Well,  my  boy,  you  ought  to  know  him.  He's  an  extraor- 
dinary fellow;  a  kind  of  faded,  wrinkled,  painted  baby,  who 
lives  on  cocktails  and  writes  charming  verses  when  he's  drunk. 
You'll  see  some  in  our  first  number.  So  Strouvilhou  had  the  bril- 
liant idea  of  sending  him  to  Passavant,  to  take  your  place.  You 
can  imagine  his  entry  into  the  Rue  de  Babylone  mansion.  I  must 
tell  you  that  Cob-Lafleur's  clothes  are  covered  with  stains;  that 
he  has  flowing  flaxen  locks,  which  fall  upon  his  shoulders;  and 
that  he  looks  as  if  he  hadn't  washed  for  a  week.  Passavant,  who 
always  wants  to  be  master  of  the  situation,  declares  that  he  took 
a  great  fancy  to  Cob-Lafleur.  Cob-Lafleur  has  a  gentle,  smiling, 
timid  way  with  him.  When  he  chooses  he  can  look  like  Ban- 
ville's  Gringoire.  In  a  word,  Passavant  was  taken  by  him  and 
was  on  the  point  of  engaging  him.  I  must  tell  you  that  Lafleur 
hasn't  got  a  penny  piece.  .  .  .  So  he  gets  up  to  take  leave : — 'Be- 
fore leaving,  Monsieur  le  Comte,  I  think  it's  only  right  to  in- 
form you  that  I  have  a  few  faults.' — 'Which  of  us  has  not?' — • 
'And  a  few  vices.  I  smoke  opium.' — 'Is  that  all?'  says  Passavant, 
who  isn't  to  be  put  off  by  a  little  thing  of  that  kind;  'I've  got 
some  excellent  stufi'  to  olTer  you.' — 'Yes,  but  when  I  smoke  it,  I 
completely  lose  every  notion  of  spelling.'  Passavant  took  this  for 
a  joke,  forced  a  laugh  and  held  out  his  hand.  Lafleur  goes  on: — 
'And  then  I  take  hasheesh.' — 'I  have  sometimes  taken  it  myself,' 
says  Passavant. — 'Yes,  but  when  I  am  under  the  influence  of 
hasheesh,  I  can't  keep  from  stealing.'  Passavant  began  to  see 
then  that  he  was  being  made  a  fool  of;  and  Lafleur,  who  was 
set  going  by  now,  rattled  on,  impulsively: — 'And  besides,   I 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  342 

drink  ether;  and  then  I  tear  everything  to  bits — 1  smash  every- 
thing I  can  lay  my  hands  on/  and  he  seizes  a  glass  vase  and 
makes  as  if  he  were  going  to  throw  it  into  the  fire.  Passavant 
just  had  time  to  snatch  it  out  of  his  hands. — 'Much  obliged  to 
you  for  warning  me.'  " 

"And  he  chucked  him  out?" 

"Yes;  and  watched  out  of  the  window  to  see  Lafleur  didn't 
drop  a  bomb  into  the  cellar  as  he  left." 

"But  why  did  Lafleur  behave  so?  From  what  you  say,  he  was 
really  in  need  of  the  place." 

"All  the  same,  my  dear  fellow,  you  must  admit  that  there 
are  people  who  feel  impelled  to  act  against  their  interest.  And 
then,  if  you  want  to  know,  Lafleur  .  .  .  well,  Passavant's  lux- 
ury disgusted  him — his  elegance,  his  amiable  manners,  his  con- 
descension, his  affectation  of  superiority.  Yes;  it  turned  his 
stomach.  And  I  add  that  I  perfectly  understand  him.  ...  At 
bottom,  your  Passavant  makes  one's  gorge  rise." 

"Why  do  you  say  'your  Passavant'?  You  know  quite  well 
that  I've  given  him  up.  And  then  why  have  you  accepted  his 
place,  if  you  think  him  so  disgusting?" 

"For  the  very  reason  that  I  like  things  that  disgust  me  .  .  . 
to  start  with  my  own  delightful — or  disgusting — self.  And  then, 
in  reality,  Cob-Lafleur  suffers  from  shyness;  he  wouldn't  have 
said  any  of  all  that  if  he  hadn't  felt  ill  at  ease." 

"Oh!  come  now!" 

"Certainly.  He  was  ill  at  ease,  and  he  was  furious  at  being 
made  to  feel  ill  at  ease  by  someone  he  really  despises.  It  was  to 
conceal  his  shyness  that  he  bluffed." 

"I  call  it  stupid." 

"My  dear  fellow,  everyone  can't  be  as  intelligent  as  you  are." 

"You  said  that  last  time,  too." 

"What  a  memory!" 

Olivier  was  determined  to  hold  his  ground. 

"I  try,"  said  he,  "to  forget  your  jokes.  But  last  time  you  did 
at  last  talk  to  me  seriously.  You  said  things  I  can't  forget." 

Armand's  eyes  grew  troubled.  He  went  off  into  a  forced  laugh. 

"Oh,  old  fellow,  last  time  I  talked  to  you  as  you  wanted  to  be 


343  ARMAND  AND  OLIVIER 

talked  to.  You  called  for  something  in  a  minor  key,  so,  in  order 
to  please  you,  I  played  my  lament,  witii  a  soul  like  a  corkscrew 
and  anguish  a  la  Pascal.  ...  It  can't  be  helped,  you  know.  I'm 
only  sincere  when  I'm  cracking  jokes." 

"You'll  never  make  me  believe  that  you  weren't  sincere  when 
you  talked  to  me  as  you  did  that  day.  It's  now  that  you  are 
playing  a  part." 

"Oh,  simplicity!  What  a  pure  angelic  soul  you  possess!  As 
if  we  weren't  all  playing  parts  more  or  less  sincerely  and  con- 
sciously. Life,  my  dear  fellow,  is  nothing  but  a  comedy.  But 
the  difference  between  you  and  me  is  that  I  know  I  am  playing 
a  part,  whilst  ..." 

"Whilst  .  .  ."  repeated  Olivier  aggressively. 

"Whilst  my  father,'  for  instance,  not  to  speak  of  you,  is  com- 
pletely taken  in  when  he  plays  at  being  a  pastor.  Whatever  I 
say  or  do,  there's  always  one  part  of  myself  which  stays  behind, 
and  watches  the  other  part  compromise  itself,  which  laughs  at 
and  hisses  it,  or  applauds  it.  When  one  is  divided  in  that  way, 
how  is  it  possible  to  be  sincere?  I  have  got  to  the  point  of  ceasing 
to  understand  what  the  word  means.  It  can't  be  helped;  when 
I'm  sad,  I  seem  so  grotesque  to  myself  that  it  makes  me  laugh; 
when  I'm  cheerful,  I  make  such  idiotic  jokes  that  I  feel  inclined 
to  cry." 

"You  make  me  feel  inclined  to  cry  too,  my  dear  boy.  I  didn't 
think  you  were  in  such  a  bad  way." 

Armand  shrugged  his  shoulders  and  went  on  in  a  totally  dif- 
ferent tone  of  voice: 

"To  console  you,  should  you  like  to  know  the  contents  of  our 
first  number?  Well,  there's  my  Nocturnal  Vase;  four  songs  by 
Cob-Lafleur;  a  dialogue  by  Jarry;  some  prose  poems  by  young 
Gheridanisol,  one  of  our  boarders;  and  then  The  Flat  Iron,  a 
vast  essay  in  general  criticism,  in  which  the  tendencies  of  the  re- 
view will  be  more  or  less  definitely  laid  down.  Several  of  us  have 
combined  together  to  produce  this  chef-d'ceuvre." 

Olivier,  not  knowing  what  to  say,  objected  clumsily: 

"No  chef-d'ceuvre  was  ever  produced  by  several  people  to- 
gether." 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  344 

Armand  burst  out  laughing: 

"But,  my  dear  fellow,  I  said  it  was  a  chef-d'ceuvre  as  a  joke. 
It  isn't  a  chef-d'ceuvre;  it  isn't  anything  at  all.  And,  for  that 
matter,  what  does  one  mean  by  chef-d'oeuvre?  That's  just  what 
The  Flat  Iron  tries  to  get  to  the  bottom  of.  There  are  heaps  of 
works  one  admires  on  faith,  just  because  everyone  else  does, 
and  because  no  one  so  far  has  thought  of  saying — or  dared  to 
say — that  they  were  stupid.  For  instance,  on  the  first  page  of 
this  number,  we  are  going  to  give  a  reproduction  of  the  Monna 
Lisa,  with  a  pair  of  moustaches  stuck  on  to  her  face.  You'll  see! 
The  effect  is  simply  staggering." 

"Does  that  mean  you  consider  the  Monna  Lisa  a  stupidity?" 

"Not  at  all,  my  dear  fellow.  (Though  I  don't  think  it  as  mar- 
vellous as  all  that.)  You  don't  understand  me.  The  thing  that's 
stupid  is  people's  admiration  for  it.  It's  the  habit  they  have  got 
of  speaking  of  what  are  called  chefs-d'oeuvre  with  bated  breath. 
The  object  of  The  Flat  Iron  (it's  to  be  the  name  of  the  review 
too)  is  to  make  this  reverence  appear  grotesque — to  discredit 
it.  ,  .  .  Another  good  plan  is  to  hold  up  to  the  reader's  admira- 
tion something  absolutely  idiotic  (my  'Nocturnal  Vase  for  in- 
stance) by  an  author  who  is  absolutely  senseless." 

"Does  Passavant  approve  of  all  this?" 

"He's  very  much  amused  by  it." 

"I  see  I  did  well  to  retire." 

"Retire!  .  .  .  Sooner  or  later,  old  man,  willynilly,  one  always 
has  to  end  by  retiring.  This  wise  reflection  naturally  leads  me 
to  take  my  leave." 

"Stop  a  moment,  you  old  clown.  .  .  .  What  made  you  say 
just  now  that  your  father  played  the  part  of  pastor?  Don't  you 
think  he  is  in  earnest?" 

"My  revered  father  has  so  arranged  his  life  that  he  hasn't 
the  right  now — or  even  the  power — not  to  be  in  earnest.  Yes,  it's 
his  profession  to  be  in  earnest.  He's  a  professor  of  earnestness. 
He  inculcates  faith;  it's  his  raison  d'etre;  it's  the  role  he  has 
chosen  and  he  must  go  through  with  it  to  the  very  end.  But  as 
for  knowing  what  goes  on  in  what  he  calls  his  'inner  conscious- 
ness' ...  it  would  be  indiscreet  to  enquire.  And  I  don't  think 


345  ARMAND  AND  OLIVIER 

he  ever  enquires  himself.  He  manages  in  such  a  way  that  he 
never  has  time  to.  He  has  crammed  his  life  full  of  a  lot  of 
obligations  which  would  lose  all  meaning  if  his  conviction 
failed;  so  that  in  a  manner  they  necessitate  his  conviction  and 
at  the  same  time  keep  it  going.  He  imagines  he  believes,  because 
he  continues  to  act  as  if  he  did.  If  his  faith  failed,  my  dear  fel- 
low, why,  it  would  be  a  catastrophic  collapse!  And  reflect,  that 
at  the  same  time  my  family  would  cease  to  have  anything  to 
live  on.  That's  a  fact  that  must  be  taken  into  consideration,  old 
boy.  Papa's  faith  is  our  means  of  subsistence.  So  that  to  come 
and  ask  me  if  Papa's  faith  is  genuine,  is  not,  you  must  admit, 
a  very  tactful  proceeding  on  your  part." 

"I  thought  you  lived  chiefly  on  what  the  school  brings  in." 

"Yes;  there's  some  truth  in  that.  But  that's  not  very  tactful 
either — to  cut  me  short  in  my  lyrical  flights." 

"And  you  then?  Don't  you  believe  in  anything?"  asked 
Olivier  sadly,  for  he  was  fond  of  Armand,  and  his  ugliness 
pained  him. 

"Juhes  renovare  dolorem.  .  .  You  seem  to  forget,  my  dear 
friend,  that  my  parents  wanted  to  make  a  pastor  of  me.  They 
nourished  me  on  pious  precepts — fed  me  up  with  them,  if  I  may 
say  so.  .  .  .  But  finally  they  were  obliged  to  recognize  that  I 
hadn't  the  vocation.  It's  a  pity.  I  might  have  made  a  first- 
class  preacher.  But  my  vocation  was  to  write  The  Nocturnal 
Vase." 

"You  poor  old  thing!  If  you  knew  how  sorry  I  am  for  you!" 

"You  have  always  had  what  my  father  calls  'a  heart  of  gold' 
...  I  won't  trespass  on  it  any  longer." 

He  took  up  his  hat.  He  had  almost  left  the  room,  when  he 
suddenly  turned  round: 

"You  haven't  asked  after  Sarah?" 

"Because  you  could  tell  me  nothing  that  I  haven't  heard  from 
Bernard." 

"Did  he  tell  you  that  he  had  left  the  pension?" 

"He  told  me  that  your  sister  Rachel  had  requested  him  to 
leave." 

Armand  had  one  hand  on  the  door  handle;  with  his  walking- 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  346 

stick  in  the  other,  he  pushed  up  the  portiere.  The  stick  went  into 
a  hole  in  the  portiere  and  made  it  bigger. 

"Account  for  it  how  you  will,"  said  he,  and  his  face  became 
very  grave.  "Rachel  is,  I  believe,  the  only  person  in  the  world 
I  love  and  respect.  I  respect  her  because  she  is  virtuous.  And  I 
always  behave  in  such  a  way  as  to  offend  her  virtue.  As  for 
Bernard  and  Sarah,  she  had  no  suspicions.  It  was  I  who  told 
her  the  whole  thing.  .  .  .  And  the  oculist  said  she  wasn't  to 
cry!  It's  comic!" 

"Am  I  to  think  you  sincere  now?" 

"Yes,  I  think  the  most  sincere  thing  about  me  is  a  horror — a 
hatred  of  everything  people  call  Virtue.  Don't  try  to  under- 
stand. You  have  no  idea  what  a  Puritan  bringing-up  can  do  to 
one.  It  leaves  one  with  an  incurable  resentment  in  one's  heart 
...  to  judge  by  myself,"  he  added,  with  a  jarring  laugh. 

He  put  down  his  hat  and  went  up  to  the  window.  "Just  look 
here;  on  the  inside  of  my  lip?" 

He  stooped  towards  Olivier  and  lifted  up  his  lip  with  his 
finger. 

"I  can't  see  anything." 

"Yes,  you  can;  there;  in  the  corner." 

Olivier  saw  a  whitish  spot  near  the  corner.  A  little  uneasily: 
"It's  a  gum-boil,"  he  said  to  reassure  Armand. 

But  Armand  shrugged  his  shoulders. 

"Don't  talk  nonsense — such  a  serious  fellow  as  you!  A  gum- 
boil's soft  and  it  goes  away.  This  is  hard  and  gets  larger  every 
week.  And  it  gives  me  a  kind  of  bad  taste  in  my  mouth." 

"Have  you  had  it  long?" 

"It's  more  than  a  month  since  I  first  noticed  it.  But  as  the 
chef-d'oeuvre  says :  ' Mon  mal  vient  de  plus  loin.  .  .  .'  " 

"Well,  old  boy,  if  you're  anxious  about  it,  you  had  better 
consult  a  doctor." 

"You  don't  suppose  I  needed  your  advice  for  that." 

"What  did  he  say?" 

"I  didn't  need  your  advice  to  say  to  myself  that  I  ought  to 
consult  a  doctor.  But  all  the  same,  I  didn't  consult  one,  because 
if  it's  what  I  think,  I  prefer  not  to  know  it." 


347  ARMAND   AND  OLIVIER 

"It's  idiotic." 

"Isn't  it  stupid?  But  so  human,  my  friend,  so  human.  .  .  ." 

"The  idiotic  thing  is  not  to  be  treated  for  it." 

"So  that  when  one  is  treated,  one  can  always  say:  Too  late!' 

That's  what  Cob-Lafleur  expresses  so  well  in  one  of  his  poems 

which  you'll  see  in  the  review : 

'II  faut  se  rendre  a  I'evidence; 
Car,  dans  ce  bas  monde,  la  danse 
Precede  souvent  la  chanson.' " 

"One  can  make  literature  out  of  anything." 

"Just  so;  out  of  anything.  But,  dear  friend,  it's  not  so  easy 
as  all  that.  Well,  good-bye.  ...  Oh!  there's  one  thing  more  I 
wanted  to  tell  you.  I've  heard  from  Alexandre.  .  .  .  Yes,  you 
know — my  eldest  brother,  who  ran  away  to  Africa.  He  began 
by  coming  to  grief  over  his  business  and  running  through  all 
the  money  Rachel  sent  him.  He's  settled  now  on  the  banks  of  the 
Casamance;  and  he  has  written  to  say  that  things  are  doing  well 
and  that  he'll  soon  be  able  to  pay  everything  back." 

"What  kind  of  a  business?" 

"Heaven  knows!  Rubber,  ivory,  Negroes  perhaps  ...  a  lot 
of  odds  and  ends.  ...  He  has  asked  me  to  go  out  to  him." 

"Will  you  go?" 

"I  would  to-morrow,  if  it  weren't  for  my  military  service. 
Alexandre  is  a  kind  of  donkey,  something  in  my  style.  I  think 
I  should  get  on  with  him  very  well.  .  .  .  Here!  would  you  like 
to  see?  I've  got  his  letter  with  me." 

He  took  an  envelope  out  of  his  pocket,  and  several  sheets  of 
note-paper  out  of  the  envelope;  he  chose  one,  and  held  it  out 
to  Olivier. 

"There's  no  need  to  read  it  all.  Begin  here." 

Olivier  read: 

"For  the  last  fortnight,  I  have  been  living  in  company  with 
a  singular  individual  whom  I  have  taken  into  my  hut.  The 
sun  of  these  parts  seems  to  have  touched  him  in  the  upper 
story.  I  thought  at  first  it  was  delirium,  but  there's  no  doubt 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  348 

it's  just  plain  madness.  This  curious  young  man  is  about 
thirty  years  old,  tall,  strong,  good-looking,  and  certainly  'a 
gentleman,'  to  judge  from  his  manners,  his  language,  and  his 
hands,  which  are  too  delicate  ever  to  have  done  any  rough 
work.  The  strange  thing  about  him  is  that  he  thinks  him- 
self possessed  by  the  devil — or  rather,  as  far  as  I  can  make 
out,  he  thinks  he  is  the  devil.  He  must  have  had  some  odd 
adventure  or  other,  for  when  he  is  dreaming  or  half  dozing, 
a  state  into  which  he  often  falls  (and  then  he  talks  to  him- 
self as  if  1  weren't  there)  he  continually  speaks  of  hands  being 
cut  off,  and  as  at  those  times  he  gets  extremely  excited  and  rolls 
his  eyes  in  an  alarming  manner,  I  take  care  that  there  shall 
be  no  weapons  within  reach.  The  rest  of  the  time,  he  is  a  good 
fellow  and  an  agreeable  ccwnpanion — which  I  appreciate,  as 
you  can  imagine,  after  months  of  solitude.  Besides  which,  he 
is  of  great  assistance  to  me  in  my  work.  He  never  speaks  of 
his  past  life,  so  that  I  can't  succeed  in  discovering  who  he 
can  be.  He  is  particularly  interested  in  plants  and  insects,  and 
sometimes  in  his  talk  shows  signs  of  being  remarkably  well 
educated.  He  seems  to  like  staying  with  me  and  doesn't  speak 
of  leaving;  I  have  decided  to  let  him  stay  as  long  as  he 
likes.  I  was  wanting  a  help;  all  things  considered,  he  has  come 
just  in  the  nick  of  time. 

"A  hideous  Negro  who  came  up  the  Casamance  with  him, 
and  to  whom  I  have  talked  a  little,  speaks  of  a  woman  who 
was  with  him,  and  who,  I  gather,  must  have  been  drowned  in 
the  river  one  day  when  their  boat  upset.  I  shouldn't  be  sur- 
prised to  learn  that  my  companion  had  had  a  finger  in  the  ac- 
cident. In  this  country,  if  one  wants  to  get  rid  of  anyone,  there 
is  a  great  choice  of  means,  and  no  one  ever  asks  a  question.  If 
one  day  I  learn  anything  more,  I'll  write  it  to  you — or  rather  I'll 
tell  you  about  it  when  you  come  out.  Yes,  I  know,  there's  your 
service.  .  .  .  Well,  I'll  wait.  For  you  may  be  sure  that  if  ever 
you  want  to  see  me  again,  you  will  have  to  make  up  your  mind 
to  come  out.  As  for  me,  I  want  to  come  back  less  and  less.  I 
lead  a  life  here  which  I  like  and  which  suits  me  down  to  the 
ground.  My  business  is  flourishing,  and  that  badge  of  civiliza- 
tion— the  starched  collar — appears  to  me  a  straight  waistcoat 
which  I  shall  never  be  able  to  endure  again. 

"I  enclose  a  money  order  which  you  can  do  what  you  like

349  ARMAND  AND  OLIVIER 

"The  rest  isn't  interesting,"  said  Armand. 

Olivier  gave  the  letter  back  without  saying  anything.  It  never 
occurred  to  him  that  the  murderer  it  spoke  of  was  his  brother. 
Vincent  had  given  no  news  of  himself  for  a  long  time;  his 
parents  thought  he  was  in  America.  To  tell  the  truth,  Olivier 
did  not  trouble  much  about  him. 


"THE  STRONG  MEN" 

It  was  only  a  month  later  that  Boris  heard  of  Bronja's  death 
from  Madame  Sophroniska,  who  came  to  see  him  at  the  pension. 
Since  his  friend's  last  sad  letter,  Boris  had  been  without  news. 
Madame  Sophroniska  came  into  Madame  Vedel's  drawing-room 
one  day  when  he  was  sitting  there,  as  was  his  habit  during 
recreation  hour,  and  as  she  was  in  deep  mourning,  he  under- 
stood everything  before  she  said  a  word.  They  were  alone  in  the 
room.  Sophroniska  took  Boris  in  her  arms  and  they  cried  to- 
gether. She  could  only  repeat:  "My  poor  little  thing.  .  .  .  My 
poor  little  thing  .  .  ."  as  if  Boris  was  the  person  to  be  pitied, 
and  as  though  she  had  forgotten  her  own  maternal  grief  in  the 
presence  of  the  immense  grief  of  the  little  boy. 

Madame  Vedel,  who  had  been  told  of  Madame  Sophroniska's 
arrival,  came  in,  and  Boris,  still  convulsed  with  sobs,  drew  aside 
to  let  the  two  ladies  talk  to  each  other.  He  would  have  liked 
them  not  to  speak  of  Bronja.  Madame  Vedel,  who  had  not 
known  her,  spoke  of  her  as  she  would  of  any  ordinary  child. 
Even  the  questions  which  she  asked  seemed  to  Boris  tactless  and 
commonplace.  He  would  have  liked  Sophroniska  not  to  answer 
them  and  it  hurt  him  to  see  her  exhibiting  her  grief.  He  folded 
his  away  and  hid  it  like  a  treasure. 

It  was  certainly  of  him  that  Bronja  was  thinking  when,  a 
few  days  before  her  death,  she  said  to  her  mother: 

"Do  tell  me.  Mamma.  .  .  .  What  is  meant  exactly  by  an 
idyll?" 

These  words  pierced  Boris's  heart  and  he  would  have  liked  to 
be  the  only  one  to  hear  them. 

Madame  Vedel  offered  her  guest  tea.  There  was  some  for 
Boris,  too;  he  swallowed  it  hastily  as  recreation  was  finishing; 


351  "THE  STRONG   MEN" 

then  he  said  good-bye  to  Sophroniska,  who  was  leaving  next 
day  for  Poland  on  business. 

The  whole  world  seemed  a  desert  to  him.  His  mother  was  too 
far  away  and  always  absent;  his  grandfather  too  old;  even 
Bernard,  with  whom  he  was  beginning  to  feel  at  home,  had  gone 
away.  .  .  .  His  was  a  tender  soul;  he  had  need  of  someone  at 
whose  feet  he  could  lay  his  nobility,  his  purity,  as  an  offering. 
He  was  not  proud  enough  to  take  pleasure  in  pride.  He  had 
loved  Bronja  too  much  to  be  able  to  hope  that  he  would  ever 
again  find  that  reason  for  loving  which  he  had  lost  in  her.  With- 
out her,  how  could  he  believe  in  the  angels  he  longed  to  see? 
Heaven  itself  was  emptied. 

Boris  went  back  to  the  schoolroom  as  one  might  cast  oneself 
into  hell.  No  doubt  he  might  have  made  a  friend  of  Gontran  de 
Passavant;  Gontran  is  a  good,  kind  boy,  and  they  are  both 
exactly  the  same  age;  but  nothing  distracts  him  from  his  work. 
There  is  not  much  harm  in  Philippe  Adamanti  either;  he  would 
be  quite  willing  to  be  fond  of  Boris;  but  he  is  under  Gherida- 
nisol's  thumb  to  such  an  extent  that  he  does  not  dare  have  a 
single  feeling  of  his  own;  he  follows  Gheridanisol's  lead,  and 
Gheridanisol  is  always  quickening  his  pace;  and  Gheridanisol 
cannot  endure  Boris.  His  musical  voice,  his  grace,  his  girlish 
look — everything  about  him  exasperates  him.  The  very  sight  of 
Boris  seems  to  inspire  him  with  that  instinctive  aversion  which, 
in  a  herd,  makes  the  strong  fall  ruthlessly  upon  the  weak. 
It  may  be  that  he  has  listened  to  his  cousin's  teaching  and  that 
his  hatred  is  somewhat  theoretical,  for  in  his  mind  it  assumes 
the  shape  of  reprobation.  He  finds  reasons  for  being  proud  of 
his  hatred.  He  realizes  and  is  amused  by  Boris's  sensitiveness  to 
this  contempt  of  his,  and  pretends  to  be  plotting  with  George 
and  Phiphi,  merely  in  order  to  see  Boris's  eyes  grow  wide  with 
a  kind  of  anxious  interrogation. 

"Oh,  how  inquisitive  the  fellow  is!"  says  George  then.  "Shall 
we  tell  him?" 

"Not  worth  while.  He  wouldn't  understand." 

"He  wouldn't  understand."  "He  wouldn't  dare."  "He  wouldn't 
know  how."  They  are  constantly  casting  these  phrases  at  him. 


THE  COUNTERFHITERS  352 

He  suffers  horribly  from  being  kept  out  of  things.  He  cannot  un- 
derstand, indeed,  why  they  give  him  the  humiliating  nick-name 
of  "Wanting";  and  is  indignant  when  he  understands.  What 
would  not  he  give  to  be  able  to  prove  that  he  is  not  such  a 
coward  as  they  think. 

"I  cannot  endure  Boris,"  said  Gheridanisol  one  day  to 
Strouvilhou.  "Why  did  you  tell  me  to  let  him  alone?  He  doesn't 
want  to  be  let  alone  as  much  as  all  that.  He  is  always  looking 
in  my  direction.  .  .  .  The  other  day  he  made  us  all  split  with 
laughter  because  he  thought  that  a  woman  togged  out  in  her 
bearskin  meant  wearing  her  furs.  George  jeered  at  him,  and 
when  at  last  Boris  took  it  in  I  thought  he  was  going  to  howl." 

Then  Gheridanisol  pressed  his  cousin  with  questions  and 
finally  Strouvilhou  gave  him  Boris's  talisman  and  explained  its 
use. 

A  few  days  later,  when  Boris  went  into  the  schoolroom,  he 
saw  this  paper,  whose  existence  he  had  almost  forgotten,  lying 
on  his  desk.  He  had  put  it  out  of  his  mind  with  everything  else 
that  related  to  the  "magic"  of  his  early  childhood,  of  which  he 
was  now  ashamed.  He  did  not  at  first  recognize  it,  for  Ghe- 
ridanisol had  taken  pains  to  frame  the  words  of  the  incanta- 
tion 

"GAS  .  .  .  TELEPHONE  .  .  .  ONE  HUNDRED  THOUSAND 
ROUBLES." 

with  a  large  red  and  black  border  adorned  with  obscene  little 
imps,  who,  it  must  be  owned,  were  not  at  all  badly  drawn.  This 
decoration  gave  the  paper  a  fantastic — an  infernal  appearance, 
thought  Gheridanisol — which  he  calculated  would  be  likely  to 
upset  Boris. 

Perhaps  it  was  done  in  play,  but  it  succeeded  beyond  all  ex- 
pectation. Boris  blushed  crimson,  said  nothing,  looked  right  and 
left,  and  failed  to  see  Gheridanisol,  who  was  watching  him  from 
behind  the  door.  Boris  had  no  reason  to  suspect  him,  and  could 
not  understand  how  the  talisman  came  to  be  there;  it  was  as 
though  it  had  fallen  from  heaven — or  rather,  risen  up  from  hell. 
Boris  was  old  enough  to  shrug  his  shoulders,  no  doubt,  at  these 


353  "THE  STRONG   MEN" 

schoolboy  bedevilments;  but  they  stirred  troubled  waters. 
Boris  took  the  talisman  and  slipped  it  into  his  pocket.  All  the 
rest  of  the  day,  the  recollection  of  his  "magic"  practices  haunted 
him.  He  struggled  until  evening  with  unholy  solicitations  and 
then,  as  there  was  no  longer  anything  to  support  him  in  his 
struggle,  he  fell. 

He  felt  that  he  was  going  to  his  ruin,  sinking  further  and 
further  away  from  Heaven;  but  he  took  pleasure  in  so  falling — 
found  in  his  very  fall  itself  the  stuff  of  his  enjoyment. 

And  yet,  in  spite  of  his  misery,  in  the  depths  of  his  dereliction, 
he  kept  such  stores  of  tenderness,  his  companions'  contempt 
caused  him  suffering  so  keen,  that  he  would  have  dared  any- 
thing, however  dangerous,  however  foolhardy,  for  the  sake  of  a 
little  consideration. 

An  opportunity  soon  offered. 

After  they  had  been  obliged  to  give  up  their  traffic  in  false 
coins,  Gheridanisol,  George  and  Phiphi  did  not  long  remain  un- 
occupied. The  ridiculous  pranks  with  which  they  amused  them- 
selves for  the  first  few  days  were  merely  stop-gaps.  Gherida- 
nisol's  imagination  soon  invented  something  with  more  stuff 
to  it. 

The  chief  point  about  Tide  Brotherhood  of  Strong  Men  at  first 
consisted  in  the  pleasure  of  keeping  Boris  out  of  it.  But  it  soon 
occurred  to  Gheridanisol  that  it  would  be  far  more  perversely 
effective  to  let  him  in;  he  could  be  brought  in  this  way  to  enter 
into  engagements,  by  means  of  which  he  might  gradually  be 
led  on  to  the  performance  of  some  monstrous  act.  From  that 
moment  Gheridanisol  was  possessed  by  this  idea;  and  as  often 
happens  in  all  kinds  of  enterprises,  he  thought  much  less  of  the 
object  itself,  than  of  how  to  bring  it  about;  this  seems  trifling, 
but  is  perhaps  the  explanation  of  a  considerable  number  of 
crimes.  For  that  matter  Gheridanisol  was  ferocious;  but  he  felt 
it  prudent  to  hide  his  ferocity,  at  any  rate  from  Phiphi.  There 
was  nothing  cruel  about  Phiphi;  he  was  convinced  up  to  the  last 
minute  that  the  whole  thing  was  nothing  but  a  joke. 

Every  brotherhood  must  have  its  motto.  Gheridanisol,  who 
had  his  idea,  proposed:  "The  strong  man  cares  nothing  for 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  354 

life."  The  motto  was  adopted  and  attributed  to  Cicero.  George 
proposed  that,  as  a  sign  of  fellowship,  they  should  tattoo  it  on 
their  right  arms;  but  Phiphi,  who  was  afraid  of  being  hurt,  de- 
clared that  good  tattooers  could  only  be  found  in  sea-ports.  Be- 
sides which,  Gheridanisol  objected  that  tattooing  would  leave 
an  indelible  mark  which  might  be  inconvenient  later  on.  After 
all,  the  sign  of  fellowship  was  not  an  absolute  necessity; 
the  members  would  content  themselves  with  taking  a  solemn 
vow. 

At  the  moment  of  starting  the  traffic  in  false  coins,  there  had 
been  talk  of  pledges,  and  it  was  on  this  occasion  that  George 
had  produced  his  father's  letters.  But  this  idea  had  dropped. 
Such  children  as  these,  very  fortunately,  have  not  much  con- 
sistency. As  a  matter  of  fact,  they  settled  practically  nothing, 
either  as  to  "conditions  of  membership"  or  as  to  "necessary 
qualifications."  What  was  the  use,  when  it  was  taken  for  granted 
that  all  three  of  them  were  "in  it,"  and  that  Boris  was  "out 
of  it"?  On  the  other  hand  they  decreed  that  "the  person  who 
flinched  should  be  considered  as  a  traitor,  and  forever  excluded 
from  the  brotherhood."  Gheridanisol,  who  had  determined  to 
make  Boris  come  in,  laid  great  stress  upon  this  point. 

It  had  to  be  admitted  that  without  Boris  the  game  would 
have  been  dull  and  the  virtue  of  the  brotherhood  without  an 
object.  George  was  better  qualified  to  circumvent  him  than 
Gheridanisol,  who  risked  arousing  his  suspicions;  as  for  Phiphi, 
he  was  not  artful  enough  and  had  a  dislike  to  compromising 
himself. 

And  in  all  this  abominable  story,  what  perhaps  seems  to  me 
the  most  monstrous,  is  this  comedy  of  friendship  which  George 
went  through.  He  pretended  to  be  seized  with  a  sudden  affec- 
tion for  Boris;  until  then,  he  had  seemed  never  so  much  as  to 
have  set  eyes  on  him.  And  I  even  wonder  whether  he  was  not 
himself  influenced  by  his  own  acting,  and  whether  the  feelings 
he  feigned  were  not  on  the  point  of  becoming  sincere — whether 
they  did  not  actually  become  sincere  as  soon  as  Boris  responded 
to  them.  George  drew  near  him  with  an  appearance  of  tender- 


355  "THE  STRONG   MEN" 

ness;  in  obedience  to  Gheridanisol,  he  began  to  talk  to  him.  ,  .  . 
And,  at  the  first  words,  Boris,  who  was  panting  for  a  little  es- 
teem and  love,  was  conquered. 

Then  Gheridanisol  elaborated  his  plan,  and  disclosed  it  to 
Phiphi  and  George.  His  idea  was  to  invent  a  "test"  to  which 
the  member  on  whom  the  lot  fell  should  be  submitted;  and  in 
order  to  set  Phiphi  at  ease,  he  let  it  be  understood  that  things 
would  be  arranged  in  such  a  manner  that  the  lot  would  be  sure 
to  fall  on  Boris.  The  object  of  the  test  would  be  to  put  his 
courage  to  the  proof. 

The  exact  nature  of  the  test,  Gheridanisol  did  not  at  once 
divulge.  He  was  afraid  that  Phiphi  would  offer  some  resistance. 

And,  in  fact,  when  Gheridanisol  a  little  later  began  to  in- 
sinuate that  old  La  Perouse's  pistol  would  come  in  handy,  "No, 
no!"  he  cried,  "I  won't  agree  to  that." 

"What  an  ass  you  are!  It's  only  a  joke,"  retorted  George, 
who  was  already  persuaded. 

"And  then,  you  know,"  added  Gheri,  "if  you  want  to  play  the 
fool,  you  have  only  got  to  say  so.  Nobody  wants  you." 

Gheridanisol  knew  that  this  argument  always  told  with  Phi- 
phi; and  as  he  had  prepared  the  paper  on  which  each  member 
of  the  brotherhood  was  to  sign  his  name,  he  went  on :  "Only  you 
must  say  so  at  once;  because  once  you've  signed,  it'll  be  too 
late." 

"All  right.  Don't  be  in  a  rage,"  said  Phiphi.  "Pass  me  the 
paper."  And  he  signed. 

"As  for  me,  old  chap,  I'd  be  delighted,"  said  George,  with  his 
arm  fondly  wound  round  Boris's  neck;  "it's  Gheridanisol  who 
won't  have  you." 

"Why  not?" 

"Because  he's  afraid.  He  says  you'll  funk." 

"What  does  he  know  about  it?" 

"That  you'll  wriggle  out  of  it  at  the  first  test." 

"We  shall  see." 

"Would  you  really  dare  to  draw  lots?" 

"Wouldn't  1 !" 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  356 

"But  do  you  know  what  you're  letting  yourself  in  for?" 

Boris  didn't  know,  but  he  wanted  to.  Then  George  explained, 
"The  strong  man  cares  nothing  for  life."  It  remained  to  be  seen. 

Boris  felt  a  great  swimming  in  his  head;  but  he  nerved  him- 
self and,  hiding  his  agitation,  "Is  it  true  you've  signed?"  he 
asked. 

"Here!  You  can  see  for  yourself."  And  George  held  out  the 
paper,  so  that  Boris  could  read  the  three  names  on  it. 

"Have  you  .  .  ."  he  began  timidly. 

"Have  we  what?  .  .  ."  interrupted  George,  so  brutally  that 
Boris  did  not  dare  go  on.  What  he  wanted  to  ask,  as  George 
perfectly  understood,  was  whether  the  others  had  bound  them- 
selves likewise,  and  whether  one  could  be  sure  that  they  wouldn't 
funk  either. 

"No,  nothing,"  said  he;  but  from  that  moment  he  began  to 
doubt  them;  he  began  to  suspect  they  were  saving  themselves 
and  not  playing  fair.  "Well  and  good!"  thought  he  then;  "what 
do  I  care  if  they  funk?  I'll  show  them  that  I've  got  more  pluck 
than  they  have."  Then,  looking  George  straight  in  the  eyes: 
"Tell  Gheri  he  can  count  on  me." 

"Then  you'll  sign?" 

Oh!  there  was  no  need  now — he  had  given  his  word.  He  said 
simply:  "As  you  please."  And,  in  a  large  painstaking  hand,  he 
inscribed  his  name  on  the  accursed  paper,  underneath  the  signa- 
tures of  the  three  Strong  Men. 

George  brought  the  paper  back  in  triumph  to  the  two  others. 
They  agreed  that  Boris  had  behaved  very  pluckily.  They  took 
counsel  together. 

Of  course,  the  pistol  wouldn't  be  loaded!  For  that  matter  there 
were  no  cartridges.  Phiphi  still  had  fears,  because  he  had  heard 
it  said  that  sometimes  a  too  violent  emotion  is  sufficient  in  it- 
self to  cause  death.  His  father,  he  declared,  knew  of  a  case 
when  a  pretence  execution  .  .  .  But  George  shut  him  up: 

"Your  father's  a  dago!" 

No,  Gheridanisol  would  not  load  the  pistol.  There  was  no 
need  to.  The  cartridge  which  La  Perouse  had  one  day  put  into 
it.  La  Perouse  had  not  taken  out.  This  is  what  Gheridanisol 


357  "THE  STRONG   MEN" 

had  made  sure  of,  though  he  took  good  care  not  to  tell  the  oth- 
ers. 

They  put  the  names  in  a  hat;  four  little  pieces  of  paper  all 
alike,  and  folded  in  the  same  manner.  Gheridanisol,  who  was 
"to  draw,"  had  taken  care  to  write  Boris's  name  a  second  time 
on  a  fifth,  which  he  kept  in  his  hand;  and,  as  though  by  chance, 
his  was  the  name  to  come  out.  Boris  suspected  they  were  cheat- 
ing; but  he  said  nothing.  What  was  the  use  of  protesting?  He 
knew  that  he  was  lost.  He  would  not  have  lifted  a  fmger  to  de- 
fend himself;  and  even  if  the  lot  had  fallen  on  one  of  the  others, 
he  would  have  offered  to  take  his  place — so  great  was  his 
despair. 

"Poor  old  boy!  you've  no  luck,"  George  thought  it  his  duty 
to  say.  The  tone  of  his  voice  rang  so  false,  that  Boris  looked  at 
him  sadly. 

"It  was  bound  to  happen,"  he  said. 

After  that,  it  was  agreed  there  should  be  a  rehearsal.  But  as 
there  was  a  risk  of  being  caught,  they  settled  not  to  make  use 
of  the  pistol.  They  would  only  take  it  out  of  its  case  at  the 
last  moment,  for  the  real  performance.  Every  care  must  be  taken 
not  to  give  the  alarm. 

On  that  day,  therefore,  they  contented  themselves  with  fixing 
the  hour,  and  the  place,  which  they  marked  on  the  floor  with  a 
bit  of  chalk.  It  was  in  the  class-room,  on  the  right  hand  of 
the  master's  desk,  in  a  recess,  formed  by  a  disused  door,  which 
had  formerly  opened  on  to  the  entrance  hall.  As  for  the  hour,  it 
was  to  be  during  preparation.  It  was  to  take  place  in  front  of 
all  the  other  boys;  it  would  make  them  sit  up. 

They  went  through  the  rehearsal  when  the  room  was  empty, 
the  three  conspirators  being  the  only  witnesses.  But  in  reality 
there  was  not  much  point  in  this  rehearsal.  They  simply  estab- 
lished the  fact  that,  from  Boris's  seat  to  the  spot  marked  with 
chalk,  there  were  exactly  twelve  paces. 

"If  you  aren't  in  a  panic,  you'll  not  take  one  more,"  said 
George. 

"I  shan't  be  in  a  panic/'  said  Boris,  who  was  outraged  by  this 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  358 

incessant  doubt.  The  little  boy's  firmness  began  to  impress  the 
other  three.  Phiphi  considered  they  ought  to  stop  at  that.  But 
Gheridanisol  was  determined  to  carry  on  the  joke  to  the  very 
end. 

"Well!  to-morrow,"  he  said,  with  a  peculiar  smile,  which 
just  curled  the  corner  of  his  lip. 

"Suppose  we  kissed  him!"  cried  Phiphi,  enthusiastically.  He 
was  thinking  of  the  accolade  of  the  knights  of  old;  and  he  sud- 
denly flung  his  arms  round  Boris's  neck.  It  was  all  Boris  could 
do  to  keep  back  his  tears  when  Phiphi  planted  two  hearty,  child- 
ish kisses  on  his  cheeks.  Neither  George  nor  Gheri  followed 
Phiphi's  example;  George  thought  his  behaviour  rather  un- 
manly. As  for  Gheri,  what  the  devil  did  he  care!  .  .  .

BORIS 

The  next  afternoon,  the  bell  assembled  all  the  boys  in  the  class- 
room. 

Boris,  Gheridanisol,  George  and  Philippe  were  seated  on  the 
same  bench.  Gheridanisol  pulled  out  his  watch  and  put  it  down 
between  Boris  and  him.  The  hands  marked  five  thirty-five. 
Preparation  began  at  five  o'clock  and  lasted  till  six.  Five  min- 
utes to  six  was  the  moment  fixed  upon  for  Boris  to  put  an  end 
to  himself,  just  before  the  boys  dispersed;  it  was  better  so; 
it  would  be  easier  to  escape  immediately  after.  And  soon  Gheri- 
danisol said  to  Boris,  in  a  half  whisper,  and  without  looking  at 
him,  which  gave  his  words,  he  considered,  a  more  fatal  ring: 

"Old  boy,  you've  only  got  a  quarter  of  an  hour  more." 

Boris  remembered  a  story-book  he  had  read  long  ago,  in 
which,  when  the  robbers  were  on  the  point  of  putting  a  woman 
to  death,  they  told  her  to  say  her  prayers,  so  as  to  convince  her 
she  must  get  ready  to  die.  As  a  foreigner  who,  on  arriving  at 
the  frontier  of  the  country  he  is  leaving,  prepares  his  papers,  so 
Boris  searched  his  heart  and  head  for  prayers,  and  could  find 
none;  but  he  was  at  once  so  tired  and  so  over-strung,  that  he 
did  not  trouble  much.  He  tried  to  think,  but  could  not.  The 
pistol  weighed  in  his  pocket;  he  had  no  need  to  put  his  hand 
on  it  to  feel  it  there. 

"Only  ten  minutes  more." 

George,  sitting  on  Gheridanisol's  left,  watched  the  scene  out 
of  the  corner  of  his  eye,  pretending  all  the  while  not  to  see.  He 
was  working  feverishly.  The  class  had  never  been  so  quiet.  La 
Perouse  hardly  knew  his  young  rascals  and  for  the  first  time  was 
able  to  breathe.  Philippe,  however,  was  not  at  ease;  Gherida- 
nisol frightened  him;   he  was  not  very  confident  the  game 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  360 

mightn't  turn  out  badly;  his  heart  was  bursting;  it  hurt  him, 
and  every  now  and  then  he  heard  himself  heave  a  deep  sigh.  At 
last,  he  could  bear  it  no  longer,  and  tearing  a  half  sheet  of 
paper  out  of  his  copy-book  (he  was  preparing  an  examination, 
but  the  lines  danced  before  his  eyes,  and  the  facts  and  dates  in 
his  head)  scribbled  on  it  very  quickly:  "Are  you  quite  sure 
the  pistol  isn't  loaded?";  then  gave  the  note  to  George,  who 
passed  it  to  Gheri.  But  Gheri,  after  he  had  read  it,  raised  his 
shoulders,  without  even  glancing  at  Phiphi;  then,  screwing  the 
note  up  into  a  ball,  sent  it  rolling  with  a  flick  of  his  finger  till 
it  landed  on  the  very  spot  which  had  been  marked  with  chalk. 
After  which,  satisfied  with  the  excellence  of  his  aim,  he  smiled. 
This  smile,  which  began  by  being  deliberate,  remained  fixed 
till  the  end  of  the  scene;  it  seemed  to  have  been  imprinted  on 
his  features. 

"Five  minutes  more." 

He  said  it  almost  aloud.  Even  Philippe  heard.  He  was  over- 
whelmed by  a  sickening  and  intolerable  anxiety,  and  though 
the  hour  was  just  coming  to  an  end,  he  feigned  an  urgent  need 
to  leave  the  room — or  was  perhaps  seized  with  perfectly  genuine 
colic.  He  raised  his  hand  and  snapped  his  fingers,  as  boys 
do  when  they  want  to  ask  permission  from  the  master;  then, 
without  waiting  for  La  Perouse  to  answer,  he  darted  from  his 
bench.  In  order  to  reach  the  door  he  had  to  pass  in  front  of 
the  master's  desk;  he  almost  ran,  tottering  as  he  did  so. 

Almost  immediately  after  Philippe  had  left  the  room,  Boris 
rose  in  his  turn.  Young  Passavant,  who  was  sitting  behind  him, 
working  diligently,  raised  his  eyes.  He  told  Seraphine  after- 
wards that  Boris  was  frightfully  pale;  but  that  is  what  is  always 
said  on  these  occasions.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  he  stopped  looking 
almost  at  once  and  plunged  again  into  his  work.  He  reproached 
himself  for  it  bitterly  later.  If  he  had  understood  what  was  go- 
ing on,  he  would  certainly  have  been  able  to  prevent  it;  so  he 
said  afterwards,  weeping.  But  he  had  no  suspicions. 

So  Boris  stepped  forward  to  the  appointed  place;  he  walked 
slowly,  like  an  automaton — or  rather  like  a  somnambulist.  He 
had  grasped  the  pistol  in  his  right  hand,  but  still  kept  it  in  the 


361  BORIS 

pocket  of  his  coat;  he  took  it  out  only  at  the  last  moment.  The 
fatal  place  was,  as  I  have  said,  in  the  recess  made  by  a  disused 
door  on  the  right  of  the  master's  desk,  so  that  the  master  could 
only  see  it  by  leaning  forward. 

La  Perouse  leant  forward.  And  at  first  he  did  not  understand 
what  his  grandson  was  doing,  though  the  strange  solemnity  of 
his  actions  was  of  a  nature  to  alarm  him.  Speaking  as  loudly 
and  as  authoritatively  as  he  could,  he  began : 

"Master  Boris,  kindly  return  at  once  to  your  .  .  ." 

But  he  suddenly  recognized  the  pistol:  Boris  had  just  raised 
it  to  his  temple.  La  Perouse  understood  and  immediately  turned 
icy  cold  as  if  the  blood  were  freezing  in  his  veins.  He  tried  to 
rise  and  run  towards  Boris — stop  him — call  to  him.  ...  A 
kind  of  hoarse  rattle  came  from  his  throat;  he  remained  rooted 
to  the  spot,  paralytic,  shaken  by  a  violent  trembling. 

The  shot  went  off.  Boris  did  not  drop  at  once.  The  body 
stayed  upright  for  a  moment,  as  though  caught  in  the  corner 
of  the  recess;  then  the  head,  falling  on  to  the  shoulder,  bore 
it  down;  it  collapsed. 

When  the  police  made  their  enquiry  a  little  later,  they  were 
astonished  not  to  find  the  pistol  near  Boris's  body — near  the 
place,  I  mean,  where  he  fell,  for  the  little  corpse  was  carried 
away  almost  immediately  and  laid  upon  a  bed.  In  the  confusion 
which  followed,  while  Gheridanisol  had  remained  in  his  place, 
George  had  leapt  over  his  bench  and  succeeded  in  making  away 
with  the  weapon,  without  anyone's  noticing  him;  while  the 
others  were  bending  over  Boris,  he  had  first  of  all  pushed  it 
backwards  with  his  foot,  seized  it  with  a  rapid  movement,  hid- 
den it  under  his  coat,  and  then  surreptitiously  passed  it  to 
Gheridanisol.  Everyone's  attention  being  fixed  on  a  single 
point,  no  one  noticed  Gheridanisol  either,  and  he  was  able  to 
run  unperceived  to  La  Perouse's  room  and  put  the  pistol  back 
in  the  place  from  which  he  had  taken  it.  When,  in  the  course 
of  a  later  investigation,  the  police  discovered  the  pistol  in  its 
case,  it  might  have  seemed  doubtful  whether  it  had  ever  left 
it,  or  whether  Boris  had  used  it,  had  Gheridanisol  only  remem- 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  362 

bered  to  remove  the  empty  cartridge.  He  certainly  lost  his  head 
a  little — a  passing  weakness,  for  which,  I  regret  to  say,  he  re- 
proached himself  far  more  than  for  the  crime  itself.  And  yet 
it  was  this  weakness  which  saved  him.  For  when  he  came  down 
and  mixed  with  the  others,  at  the  sight  of  Boris's  dead  body  be- 
ing carried  away,  he  was  seized  with  a  fit  of  trembling,  which 
was  obvious  to  everyone — a  kind  of  nervous  attack — which 
Madame  Vedel  and  Rachel,  who  had  hurried  to  the  spot,  mis- 
took for  a  sign  of  excessive  emotion.  One  prefers  to  suppose  any- 
thing, rather  than  the  inhumanity  of  so  young  a  creature;  and 
when  Gheridanisol  protested  his  innocence,  he  was  believed. 
Phiphi's  little  note,  which  George  had  passed  him  and  which  he 
had  flicked  away  with  his  finger,  was  found  later  under  a  bench 
and  also  contributed  to  help  him.  True,  he  remained  guilty,  as 
did  George  and  Phiphi,  of  having  lent  himself  to  a  cruel  game, 
but  he  would  not  have  done  so,  he  declared,  if  he  had  thought 
the  weapon  was  loaded.  George  was  the  only  one  who  remained 
convinced  of  his  entire  responsibility. 

George  was  not  so  corrupted  but  that  his  admiration  for 
Gheridanisol  yielded  at  last  to  horror.  When  he  reached  home 
that  evening,  he  flung  himself  into  his  mother's  arms;  and 
Pauline  had  a  burst  of  gratitude  to  God,  who  by  means  of  this 
dreadful  tragedy  had  brought  her  son  back  to  her.

EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL 

Without  exactly  pretending  to  explain  anything,  I  should  not 
like  to  put  forward  any  fact  which  was  not  accounted  for  by  a 
sufficiency  of  motive.  And  for  that  reason  I  shall  not  make 
use  of  little  Boris's  suicide  for  my  Counterfeiters;  I  have  too 
much  difficulty  in  understanding  it.  And  then,  I  dislike  police 
court  items.  There  is  something  peremptory,  irrefutable,  brutal, 
outrageously  real  about  them.  ...  I  accept  reality  coming  as  a 
proof  in  support  of  my  thought,  but  not  as  preceding  it.  It 
displeases  me  to  be  surprised.  Boris's  suicide  seems  to  me  an 
indecency,  for  I  was  not  expecting  it. 

A  little  cowardice  enters  into  every  suicide,  notwithstanding 
La  Perouse,  who  no  doubt  thinks  his  grandson  was  more 
courageous  than  he.  If  the  child  could  have  foreseen  the  dis- 
aster which  his  dreadful  action  has  brought  upon  the  Vedels, 
there  would  be  no  excuse  for  him.  Azais  has  been  obliged  to 
break  up  the  school — for  the  time  being,  he  says;  but  Rachel  is 
afraid  of  ruin.  Four  families  have  already  removed  their  chil- 
dren. I  have  not  been  able  to  dissuade  Pauline  from  taking 
George  away,  so  that  she  may  keep  him  at  home  with  her; 
especially  as  the  boy  has  been  profoundly  shaken  by  his  school- 
fellow's death,  and  seems  inclined  to  reform.  What  repercus- 
sions this  calamity  has  had!  Even  Olivier  is  touched  by  it. 
Armand,  notwithstanding  his  cynical  airs,  feels  such  anxiety 
at  the  ruin  which  is  threatening  his  family,  that  he  has  offered 
to  devote  the  time  that  Passavant  leaves  him,  to  working  in  the 
school,  for  old  La  Perouse  has  become  manifestly  incapable  of 
doing  what  is  required  of  him. 

I  dreaded  seeing  him  again.  It  was  in  his  little  bedroom  on 


THE  COUNTERFEITERS  364 

the. second  floor  of  the  pension,  that  he  received  me.  He  took  me 
by  the  arm  at  once,  and  with  a  mysterious,  almost  a  smiling  air, 
which  greatly  surprised  me,  for  1  was  expecting  tears: 

"That  noise,"  he  said,  "you  know  ...  the  noise  I  told  you 
about  the  other  day  .  .  ." 

"Well?" 

"It  has  stopped — finished.  I  don't  hear  it  any  more,  however 
much  I  listen." 

As  one  humours  a  child,  "I  wager,"  said  I,  "that  now  you 
regret  it." 

"Oh!  no;  no.  .  ,  .  It's  such  a  rest.  I  am  so  much  in  need  of 
silence.  Do  you  know  what  I've  been  thinking?  That  in  this  life 
we  can't  know  what  real  silence  is.  Even  our  blood  makes  a 
kind  of  continual  noise;  we  don't  notice  it,  because  we  have 
become  accustomed  to  it  ever  since  our  childhood.  .  .  .  But 
I  think  there  are  things  in  life  which  we  can't  succeed  in  hear- 
ing— harmonies  .  .  .  because  this  noise  drowns  them.  Yes,  I 
think  it's  only  after  our  death  that  we  shall  really  be  able  to 
hear." 

"You  told  me  you  didn't  believe  .  .  ." 

"In  the  immortality  of  the  soul?  Did  I  tell  you  that?  .  .  . 
Yes;  I  suppose  I  did.  But  I  don't  believe  the  contrary  either, 
you  know." 

And  as  I  was  silent,  he  went  on,  nodding  his  head  and  with  a 
sententious  air: 

"Have  you  noticed  that  in  this  world  God  always  keeps 
silent?  It's  only  the  devil  who  speaks.  Or  at  least,  at  least  ,  .  ." 
he  went  on,  ".  .  .  however  carefully  we  listen,  it's  only  the 
devil  we  can  succeed  in  hearing.  We  have  not  the  ears  to  hear 
the  voice  of  God.  The  word  of  God!  Have  you  ever  wondered 
what  it  is  like?  ...  Oh!  I  don't  mean  the  word  that  has  been 
transferred  into  human  language.  .  .  .  You  remember  the  Gos- 
pel: 'In  the  beginning  was  the  Word.'  I  have  often  thought  that 
the  word  of  God  was  the  whole  of  creation.  But  the  devil  seized 
hold  of  it.  His  noise  drowns  the  voice  of  God.  Oh!  tell  me,  don't 
you  think  that  all  the  same  it's  God  who  will  end  by  having  the 
last  word?  .  .  .  And  if,  after  death,  time  no  longer  exists,  if  we 


365  EDOUARD'S  JOURNAL 

enter  at  once  into  Eternity,  do  you  think  we  shall  be  able  to 
hear  God  then  .  .  .  directly?" 

A  kind  of  transport  began  to  shake  him,  as  if  he  were  going 
to  fall  down  in  convulsions,  and  he  was  suddenly  seized  by  a 
fit  of  sobbing. 

"No,  no!"  he  cried,  confusedly;  "the  devil  and  God  are  one 
and  the  same;  they  work  together.  We  try  to  believe  that  every- 
thing bad  on  earth  comes  from  the  devil,  but  it's  because,  if  we 
didn't,  we  should  never  find  strength  to  forgive  God.  He  plays 
with  us  like  a  cat,  tormenting  a  mouse.  .  .  .  And  then  after- 
wards he  wants  us  to  be  grateful  to  him  as  well.  Grateful  for 
what?  for  what?  .  .  ." 

Then,  leaning  towards  me: 

"Do  you  know  the  most  horrible  thing  of  all  that  he  has 
done?  ,  .  .  Sacrificed  his  own  son  to  save  us.  His  son!  his  son! 
.  .  .  Cruelty!  that's  the  principal  attribute  of  God." 

He  flung  himself  on  his  bed  and  turned  his  face  to  the  wall. 
For  a  few  moments  a  spasmodic  shudder  ran  through  him; 
then,  as  he  seemed  to  have  fallen  asleep,  I  left  him. 

He  had  not  said  a  word  to  me  about  Boris;  but  I  thought  that 
in  this  mystical  despair  was  to  be  seen  the  expression  of  a  grief 
too  blinding  to  be  looked  at  steadfastly. 

I  hear  from  Olivier  that  Bernard  has  gone  back  to  his 
father's;  and,  indeed,  it  was  the  best  thing  he  could  do.  When  he 
learnt,  from  a  chance  meeting  with  Caloub,  that  the  old  judge 
was  not  well,  Bernard  followed  the  impulse  of  his  heart.  We 
shall  meet  to-morrow  evening,  for  Profitendieu  has  invited  me 
to  dinner  with  Molinier,  Pauline  and  the  two  boys.  I  feel  very 
curious  to  know  Caloub. 


A   NOTE  ON   THE  TYPE   IN 
WHICH   THIS   BOOK   IS  SET 

This  hook  is  set  (on  the  Linotype)  in  Elzevir  No.  3, 
a  French  Old  Style.  For  the  modern  revival  of  this 
excellent  face  we  are  indebted  to  Giistave  Mayeur  of 
Paris,  who  reproduced  it  in  1878,  basing  his  designs, 
he  says,  on  types  used  in  a  hook  which  was  printed 
by  the  El:(evirs  at  Ley  den  in  16M.  The  El^evtr  fam- 
ily held  a  distinguished  position  as  printers  and  pub- 
lishers for  more  than  a  century,  their  best  work 
appearing  between  about  1590  and  1680.  Although 
the  Elzevirs  were  not  themselves  type  founders,  they 
utilised  the  services  of  the  best  type  designers  of  their 
time,  notably  Van  Dijk,  Garamond,  and  Sanlecque. 
Many  of  their  books  were  small,  or,  as  we  should  say 
now,  "pocket"  editions,  of  the  classics,  and  for  these 
volumes  they  developed  a  type  face  which  is  open 
and  readable  but  relatively  narrow  in  body,  al- 
though in  no  sense  condensed,  thus  permitting  a 
large  amou7tt  of  copy  to  be  set  in  limited  space  with- 
out impairing  legibility.
